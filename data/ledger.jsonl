However, I can help guide you on how to perform an annual service on hydraulic jacks, generally based on typical procedures and best practices:\n\n### Tools and Materials Needed:\n- Safety stands\n- Hydraulic fluid (check your owner's manual for the correct type)\n- Clean rags or towels\n- Oil filter wrench (if your system has a filter)\n- Grease gun with appropriate grease\n\n### Safety Precautions:\n- Ensure the RV is on a level surface and securely supported by safety stands before working under it.\n- Wear appropriate safety gear, including gloves and eye protection.\n\n### Steps for Annual Service:\n\n1. **Inspect the System:**\n   - Check hoses and connections for any signs of wear, cracks, or leaks.\n   - Inspect the jack cylinders for leaks and ensure the rods are clean and free of rust or pitting.\n\n2. **Check and Top Off Hydraulic Fluid:**\n   - Locate the hydraulic reservoir, which is often part of the pump assembly.\n   - Clean the area around the cap to prevent contamination.\n   - Remove the cap and check the fluid level. Top off with the specified hydraulic fluid if necessary.\n   - Replace the cap securely.\n\n3. **Inspect and Change the Filter:**\n   - If your hydraulic system has a filter, inspect and replace it according to the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations.\n   - Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old filter and install a new one, ensuring a proper seal to prevent leaks.\n\n4. **Grease Moving Parts:**\n   - Use a grease gun to lubricate any grease fittings on the jacks or nearby components. This helps maintain smooth operation.\n   \n5. **Test the System:**\n   - Operate the jacks through a full cycle to test for proper function, listening for any unusual noises and ensuring they extend and retract smoothly.\n   - Re-check for leaks after cycling the system.\n\n6. **Additional Checks:**\n   - Inspect the control panel and electronic components for any visible signs of damage or corrosion.\n   - Ensure all mounting bolts and hardware are correctly torqued to the manufacturer specifications.\n\nIt‚Äôs always important to refer to the RV's specific service manual or manufacturer for detailed instructions and specifications, as procedures can vary between systems.

Byrkit Ave, Mishawaka, IN 46544\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nCritical notes\n- Always use the current Lippert torque charts, measurement drawings, and procedures based on the axle serial/model. Do not rely on generic or ‚Äútypical‚Äù values.\n- Wheel fastener torque specs are for clean, dry threads unless otherwise specified by OEM. Do not lubricate studs/nuts unless explicitly directed by the manufacturer.\n\nTorque references (verify exact values with Lippert/OEM)\n- Wheel lug nuts: per Lippert/RV placard for stud size and wheel type; torque in stages and star pattern.\n- Suspension hardware (U-bolts, shackle/equalizer/hanger/eye bolts): per Lippert torque charts and tightening procedures. Replace U-bolts if loosened/removed.\n\nMeasurements and tolerances (verify with Lippert)\n- Perform hanger spacing/diagonal measurements and shackle orientation checks at normal operating load and ride height on level, flat ground.\n- Hanger spacing and diagonals: per Lippert Single/Double/Triple Axle Hanger Measurement Procedure; must be within Lippert tolerances.\n- Axle tube camber (‚Äúarc‚Äù): slight positive camber at center per Lippert method; any loss of prescribed arc indicates a bent/overloaded axle.\n- Shackle orientation: must match Lippert reference for the specific equalizer/shackle length at normal ride height.\n- Tire pressures: set to RV placard/OEM guidance (cold). If OEM specifies sidewall max for ST tires, follow OEM guidance.\n\nOperating pressures/voltages\n- Tire inflation: per RV placard/OEM guidance (cold).\n- Electric brake supply: nominal 12 VDC per OEM.\n\nPROCEDURE\n1) Pre-work\n- Verify scope and axle configuration (single/double/triple).\n- Identify axle: locate and record Lippert axle tag serial/model, GAWR, hub/brake type.\n- Obtain and review the current Lippert torque charts, measurement drawings, shackle orientation references, camber criteria, brake adjustment, and burnish procedures for the identified axle.\n- Verify torque wrenches are in calibration; record tool IDs and calibration due dates.\n- Site prep: level ground, chocks placed, LOTO applied, tools staged.\n\n2) Secure and lift\n- Preferred lift points: Use manufacturer-approved frame lift points. Support the RV on rated jack stands under the frame or spring hangers.\n- Capacity: Ensure each jack/stand meets or exceeds the load at that point (e.g., per-side axle load/GAWR).\n- If OEM/Lippert explicitly permits, you may lift under the axle at the spring seat only, using a load-spreading saddle/block. Protect brake wiring; ensure the saddle/block contacts only the spring seat and does not contact the axle tube mid-span, brake backing plate, or brake lines.\n- Raise only enough to unload wheels as required. Keep the suspension at normal ride height (use ramps or stands under axle tubes at spring seats as allowed) when checking shackle orientation and taking alignment measurements.\n\n3) Tire condition inspection\n- Record tread depths across each tire (inner/middle/outer).\n- Inspect for cuts, bulges, punctures/embedded objects, cupping, feathering, and sidewall cracking.\n- Check DOT date codes; recommend replacement at 5‚Äì7 years in service or per OEM, regardless of tread.\n- Inspect valve stems:\n  - Rubber stems: check for age-related cracking; replace with stems rated for the tire‚Äôs pressure (proper TR rating).\n  - Metal stems: verify sealing washer condition and nut torque per stem manufacturer; ensure proper orientation/clearance.\n\n4) Tire pressure (How to Check Tire Pressure)\n- Measure cold inflation with an accurate gauge.\n- Adjust to RV placard/OEM-specified cold pressure. Record before/after.\n\n5) Wheel/rim inspection (How to Inspect the Wheel Rim)\n- Inspect rims for cracks (especially at lug holes), bends, bead-seat corrosion, and elongated lug holes.\n- Verify valve stems are sound and correctly installed. Replace any damaged rim or valve stem components.\n\n6) Wheel lug torque (How to Check Torque Specs on Wheels)\n- With wheels on the ground (or lightly loaded per wheel manufacturer), torque lug nuts in a star pattern to the verified spec.\n- Use a torque wrench for final torque; do not rely on an impact for final tightening.\n- Apply a torque stripe from each lug nut to the wheel.\n\n7) Suspension inspection and hardware policy (How to Inspect Shackle Links; How to Tighten Suspension Hardware)\n- Inspect shackle links, bushings, equalizer, hangers for wear, cracks, elongation, or deformation.\n- Leaf springs: check for cracked/broken leaves, shifted/broken clips, misaligned or sheared center bolt at the spring seat, and spring eye elongation.\n- U-bolts: verify proper seating and clamp. If U-bolts are loosened or removed for any reason, replace with new of correct size/grade and torque per Lippert in a cross pattern. Do not reuse U-bolts.\n- Hardware reuse: Replace prevailing-torque lock nuts and distorted-thread nuts on suspension components when removed unless OEM explicitly allows reuse.\n- Torquing condition: You may snug hardware at droop to assemble, but perform final torque of shackle/equalizer/eye bolts at normal ride height with weight on the suspension (use ramps or stands under spring seats as allowed) to avoid bushing preload.\n- Wet bolts/zerks: confirm zerk integrity; repair/replace any damaged fittings.\n\n8) Suspension lubrication (wet bolts/equalizers, if equipped)\n- Using a hand-operated grease gun and compatible chassis grease, lubricate wet bolts/equalizer zerks until fresh grease appears at bushing interfaces. Do not over-pressurize. Wipe excess.\n\n9) Shackle orientation (How to Check Shackle Orientation)\n- With suspension at normal ride height and on level ground, verify shackle angle/orientation per Lippert reference for the installed equalizer/shackle lengths. Plan corrective actions if out of spec.\n\n10) Hanger measurement (Single/Double/Triple Axle Hanger Measurement Procedure)\n- On level ground at normal operating load/ride height, establish a datum (e.g., front hanger center).\n- Measure center-to-center hanger distances and diagonals for squareness.\n- Record and compare to Lippert drawings/tolerances. If out of tolerance, stop and escalate for alignment/hanger repair.\n\n11) Axle tube camber (How to Check Axle Tube Camber; Checking for Loss of Arc)\n- With the axle unloaded enough for accurate reading but not twisted by uneven support, use a straight edge/string line along the axle tube and measure arc at center per Lippert method.\n- Any loss of specified arc indicates a bent/overloaded axle; do not attempt to re-bend‚Äîescalate to replacement.\n\n12) Electric drum brake inspection/adjustment (where applicable)\n- Inspect brake wiring for chafe, damage, and secure grounds.\n- Adjust brakes per Lippert/OEM: tighten adjuster to lock, then back off the specified number of clicks to obtain light, even drag. For self-adjusting brakes, verify adjuster operation and shoe-to-drum clearance.\n- If hub removal is required, follow the Lippert service manual (outside this routine scope).\n\n13) Electrical brake functional checks\n- Verify trailer battery state of charge.\n- Perform breakaway switch test: with wheels safely off the ground or securely chocked, pull the breakaway pin and confirm each wheel‚Äôs brake applies firmly. Reinstall pin; ensure system returns to normal. Do not tow with the pin removed.\n- Measure brake magnet resistance and current draw per OEM spec for the brake size/count. Investigate any out-of-spec readings.\n\n14) Grease spindle through zerk (How to Grease a Spindle Through a Grease Zerk; EZ Lube-style hubs if equipped)\n- Clean the dust cap/zerk. If equipped with an EZ Lube-style dust cap, remove the rubber plug to provide a purge path.\n- Attach a hand-operated grease gun with compatible wheel bearing grease.\n- Slowly pump while continuously rotating the wheel/hub by hand to distribute grease.\n- Stop as soon as fresh grease purges at the outer bearing area. Do not continue if any grease appears at the rear seal or on the brake backing plate. If grease is observed at the seal/backing plate, stop and service the seal and any contaminated brakes.\n- Wipe excess grease and reinstall the rubber plug (if applicable) and dust cap.\n\n15) Spring axle dust cap replacement (Spring Axle Dust Cap Replacement)\n- If damaged/loose, remove and install new dust caps squarely and fully seated without deforming.\n\n16) Brake burnishing (The Proper Way to Burnish your Trailer Brakes)\n- After brake/hub service or poor performance, follow Lippert‚Äôs burnish procedure for the specific brake size/type (controlled moderate-speed stops with cooling periods). Avoid hard stops beyond the recommended profile.\n\n17) Final checks and lowering\n- Re-torque wheel lug nuts to spec in a star pattern; re-apply/verify torque stripes.\n- Verify all suspension fasteners are torqued at ride height and torque-striped.\n- Carefully remove stands and lower vehicle; remove chocks last.\n\n18) Road test, temperatures, and re-torque\n- Perform a controlled road test to verify tracking and braking (after burnish where applicable).\n- Immediately after the road test, measure hub/drum temperatures:\n  - Mark a small spot on each hub/drum with flat black paint or matte tape to standardize emissivity.\n  - Aim the IR thermometer at the marked spot, out of direct sunlight and away from water splash.\n  - Compare side-to-side on each axle under similar conditions. Investigate if a side differs by more than approximately 20‚Äì30¬∞F (11‚Äì17¬∞C).\n- Re-check wheel lug nut torque after the road test, again at approximately 10 miles, and again at 25‚Äì50 miles or per wheel/OEM instructions.\n\n19) Documentation\n- Record: axle serial/model; GAWR; torque wrench serial/ID and calibration due dates; torque values applied; tire sizes/pressures; tire tread depths and DOT dates; valve stem type/condition; hanger spacing/diagonals and variance vs. spec; shackle orientation; camber observations; brake adjustments and functional test results (breakaway, magnet resistance/current); IR temperatures; lubrication actions; component replacements; and burnish completion.\n- Note any nonconformances and required follow-up or escalation.\n- Update the customer data sheet with the next inspection interval.\n\nCRITICAL CHECKPOINTS\n- Correct axle identification (serial/model) recorded and Lippert docs reviewed\n- Wheel and suspension torques applied at correct condition (ride height where required) and torque-striped per Lippert charts\n- Hanger spacing/diagonals within Lippert tolerances at normal load/ride height\n- Shackle orientation per Lippert reference at ride height\n- Axle tube camber within spec; no loss of arc\n- No wheel/rim cracks or lug hole elongation; valve stems serviceable and correct rating\n- Tire pressures set to OEM/placard spec (cold); tire age/condition acceptable\n- No grease purge at seals during spindle lubrication\n- Wet bolts/equalizer zerks lubricated (if equipped)\n- Dust caps properly seated\n- Brake adjustment completed (if applicable); electrical brake and breakaway tests passed\n\nQUALITY VERIFICATION\n- Second technician verification of critical torque values/torque stripes\n- All measurements recorded with variance vs. spec and load/ride-height condition noted\n- Controlled road test completed; immediate lug re-torque performed\n- Hub face temperatures checked side-to-side at standardized aim points; variances within acceptable delta\n- Work area/tooling cleared; customer data sheet updated with next inspection interval\n\nVERIFICATION\nHow to test completion\n- Road test to verify tracking and braking (after burnish where applicable).\n- Measure hub temperatures immediately after the road test and compare side-to-side on the same axle using standardized emissivity points.\n- Re-check wheel lug nut torque after road test and per re-torque schedule.\n- Inspect for grease leaks and confirm dust caps are seated.\n- Confirm breakaway and electric brake functional checks pass.\n\nExpected results\n- Even braking with no pull or pulsation after burnish\n- Hub temperatures on each axle are consistent side-to-side for conditions (within approximately 20‚Äì30¬∞F / 11‚Äì17¬∞C)\n- No new irregular tire wear\n- Suspension hardware remains torque-striped and stationary\n- No lubricant leakage at seals; dust caps intact\n- Electrical brake system functional; breakaway test passes\n\nPass/fail criteria\n- Pass: All measurements within Lippert tolerances at normal load/ride height; all torques to spec (correct condition); correct shackle orientation; correct tire pressures; normal hub temperature comparisons; no leaks; brakes adjusted and functional; burnish completed as required.\n- Fail: Any out-of-tolerance hanger spacing/diagonal, axle camber loss, inability to achieve torque, seal leakage/over-grease evidence, damaged wheels/tires/valve stems, abnormal hub temperature deviation beyond guidance, failed electrical brake/breakaway tests, or incomplete burnish.

Immediately cap the hose end(s) and the jack port(s) with clean caps/plugs. If caps are unavailable, bag and zip-tie the hose ends as a secondary measure. Expected: Open lines sealed; minimal dripping.\n   PHOTO: Ends capped/bagged; drip pan showing captured fluid.\nNote: Single-acting rear jacks typically have one hydraulic hose (pressure to extend; spring return). Some coaches use powered-retract dual-acting cylinders with two hoses (extend and retract). Follow the configuration present on the unit.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_TITLE: Remove the Old Jack\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_STEPS:\n1. Inspect mounting (bolt-on through bracket).

Identify fitting type and prep:\n   - JIC flare (37¬∞): no sealant; ensure clean, undamaged flare seats (both male and female).\n   - ORB: replace the O-ring (Buna-N 90) and lightly lube with clean fluid. For adjustable ORB elbows, orientation is set during tightening after the O-ring is seated.\n   - NPT: apply Loctite 545 hydraulic thread sealant to male threads only, 360¬∞, starting 1‚Äì2 threads back from the end. Do not use PTFE tape. Allow at least fixture time before pressure testing (longer if <60¬∞F). If immediate testing is unavoidable, keep pressure low and recheck after full cure (~24 hours at room temp).\n   Expected: Correct sealing method chosen and applied.\n   PHOTO: Close-up of fitting type and prepared threads/O-ring.\n2. Thread by hand to avoid cross-threading. Tighten with flare nut wrench and backup wrench. Defer to Lippert or the fitting/hose manufacturer torque chart.

Do not auto-level. Expected: System powered safely.\n   PHOTO: Battery/fuse reconnected.\n2. Reservoir handling:\n   - Clean around reservoir cap/breather. Crack cap slowly to avoid debris ingress and pressure differentials. With all jacks retracted that can be safely retracted given support plan, check level and fill with identical fluid to the ‚ÄúFULL RETRACTED‚Äù mark. Verify reservoir breather is functional.\n   Expected: Correct initial level; clean reservoir service.\n   PHOTO: Reservoir cap/label and level.\n3. Bleed the replaced rear jack ‚Äî start with short strokes to limit load shifts:\n   - If controller/app supports individual jack control (service/diagnostic mode):\n     a. Enter manual/service mode (OneControl app or panel per Lippert docs).\n     b. Extend only the replaced rear jack 3‚Äì4 inches. Watch/listen for binding.\n     c. Inspect fitting(s) for leaks under slight pressure; if needed, add small incremental torque within guidance.\n     d. Retract fully; wait 30 seconds for de-aeration.\n     e. Repeat 2‚Äì3 times at 3‚Äì4 inches, then increase to 6‚Äì8 inches for an additional 2‚Äì3 cycles if the coach remains stable.\n   - If individual jack control is not available:\n     a. Extend both rear jacks together 3‚Äì4 inches while closely monitoring the repaired side.\n     b. Inspect for leaks; retract both; wait 30 seconds.\n     c. Repeat 2‚Äì3 short cycles, then 2‚Äì3 cycles at 6‚Äì8 inches if stable.\n   - If neither path is available from the panel:\n     a. Use service/diagnostic mode via OneControl mobile app or service tool per Lippert service manual, or\n     b. Trained personnel may energize the appropriate valve coil per Lippert procedures to move only the target jack.\n   - Powered-retract (dual-acting) cylinders: cycle both extend and retract under power during bleeding; expect more cycles than single-acting. Monitor both hoses/fittings for leaks in each direction. Verify correct direction on first short stroke based on your hose mapping/photo.\n   Expected: Smooth motion, no foaming, no leaks.\n   PHOTO: Jack mid-stroke; close-up of dry fitting.\n4. Top off reservoir to the retracted mark (all jacks retracted consistent with safe support plan). Secure cap; ensure breather is clear. Expected: Fluid level correct.\n   PHOTO: Final reservoir level.\n5. System test:\n   - Extend both rear jacks 6‚Äì8 inches; retract all.\n   - Observe symmetry and sounds.\n   - Wipe fittings and re-check for seepage.\n   Expected: Normal operation; fittings remain dry.\n   PHOTO: Both rear jacks extended equally.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_J_TITLE: Final Inspection, Calibration, and Documentation\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_J_STEPS:\n1. Re-verify mounting bolt torque after cycling. Apply torque paint to bolt heads. Expected: Torque confirmed and marked.\n   PHOTO: Torque paint on bolts.\n2. Restore vehicle to normal supports before any calibration:\n   - Carefully lower the frame off stands; remove all stands/cribbing; for motorhomes, only then reinflate airbags per OEM procedure. Ensure the RV rests on its normal supports (tires/landing gear/hitch).\n   Expected: Normal support restored; safe stance for calibration.\n   PHOTO: Stands removed; normal supports in use.\n3. Perform zero-point calibration if indicated or after significant re-leveling:\n   - Manually level the RV using a precision level inside the main living area.\n   - Execute the controller‚Äôs zero-point procedure per the specific OneControl/touchpad manual.\n   Expected: Zero-point updated; auto-level ready.\n   PHOTO: Control panel showing calibration complete.\n4.

On fifth wheels, retracting the front landing gear when not hitched or otherwise supported can drop the nose and cause a frame crash. This is a critical safety gap.\n‚Ä¢ Generic instruction to 'Engage parking brake' is not applicable to fifth wheels; the SOP mixes motorhome and towable language without clear branching requirements.\n‚Ä¢ JIC torque values listed in H2 (e.g., -6 JIC 16‚Äì18 ft-lb; -8 JIC 23‚Äì31 ft-lb) appear lower than many industry charts for steel fittings and may lead to leaks or reseating after pressure. The guidance could be inaccurate for Lippert fittings and hoses.\n‚Ä¢ H2 language 'then up to 1/6 turn if required for orientation' is misplaced for JIC flares (orientation applies to adjustable ORB elbows). This may confuse technicians and lead to over/under-tightening.\n‚Ä¢ Bleeding procedure I-3 assumes the controller supports individual jack control. Many LCI panels/firmware do not allow single-jack movement without service mode or a diagnostic tool/app, making the step not universally executable.\n‚Ä¢ For powered-retract cylinders (two hoses), the bleed steps do not explicitly state that both extend and retract circuits must be cycled under power to purge air on both sides of the piston.\n‚Ä¢ No explicit directive to ensure the coach is either hitched to the tow vehicle or supported under the front frame rails before retracting any hydraulics on towables.\n‚Ä¢ No mention of Loctite 545 handling/cure considerations; immediate high-pressure testing before initial set may risk micro-seepage on NPT joints depending on gaps and surface condition.\n‚Ä¢ Safety step C2 directs checking footpad free play 'by hand' without explicitly stating to keep hands out from under the coach and outside potential pinch paths; could be interpreted unsafely.\n‚Ä¢ Manual mode references (I-3) lack controller-specific menu paths or alternatives (e.g., OneControl app service mode), reducing practical completeness.\n‚Ä¢ Minor applicability gap: Step B1 'diagonally opposite' chocking is good, but air-suspension motorhomes may shift height; no instruction to dump air if recommended by OEM before frame support.\n‚Ä¢ No explicit instruction to verify the manifold valve coil for the replaced circuit is reconnected and latched after work; intermittent connectors are a common post-service issue.\n‚Ä¢ No significant issues found. The SOP is comprehensive, well-structured, and emphasizes safety and technical accuracy at a professional level.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Branch the procedure early for motorhomes vs fifth wheels: Motorhomes‚Äîset parking brake and chock. Fifth wheels‚Äîeither hitch securely to the tow vehicle or support the front frame rails with heavy-duty stands/cribbing before retracting any front landing gear. Do not command 'retract all' on towables unless the front is positively supported.\n‚Ä¢ Replace B2 with conditional steps: (a) If motorhome, command full retract, then de-energize. (b) If fifth wheel and not hitched, keep front landing gear down to maintain front support; manually retract only the rear pair or the non-affected jacks as needed. Ensure redundant frame support before opening any hydraulic connection.\n‚Ä¢ Revise JIC/ORB torque guidance in H2 to defer to Lippert or the fitting manufacturer‚Äôs torque chart. Provide typical steel fitting ranges as a reference only (e.g., -6 JIC commonly ~22‚Äì30 ft-lb; -8 JIC commonly ~40‚Äì50 ft-lb; -6 ORB commonly ~22‚Äì30 ft-lb) and instruct to verify by part and manufacturer.\n‚Ä¢ Clarify that 'orientation' adjustments after initial torque apply to adjustable ORB elbows, not JIC flare seats. For JIC, seat to torque; do not add turns solely for orientation.\n‚Ä¢ Add a controller capability check in I-3. If individual jack control is unavailable, provide alternatives: use service/diagnostic mode (OneControl app or panel), extend both rear jacks together while monitoring the repaired side, or energize the appropriate valve coil per Lippert service guidance.\n‚Ä¢ Explicitly state for powered-retract cylinders: cycle both extend and retract under power during bleeding; expect more cycles than single-acting; monitor both hoses/fittings for leaks during each direction.\n‚Ä¢ Add Loctite 545 usage detail: apply to male NPT only, avoid over-application, assemble promptly, and allow initial set before high-pressure testing per the 545 TDS. Full cure is 24 hours; initial low-pressure checks are typically acceptable‚Äîverify with TDS.\n‚Ä¢ Strengthen C2 language: verify free play without placing hands under the coach or between moving parts; use a pry bar or visual/physical check from a safe position.\n‚Ä¢ Add explicit instruction to verify the correct manifold coil connector is fully seated and latched after reassembly; tug-test each serviced connector.\n‚Ä¢ For air-suspension motorhomes, add a note to dump suspension air (if OEM recommends) before setting stands to minimize movement when jacks are commanded.\n‚Ä¢ Add an alternative system verification: after leak-free manual cycling and top-off, perform a full Auto Level test (space permitting and if safe), then retract and re-check all fittings for seepage.\n‚Ä¢ Recommend using new prevailing-torque lock nuts or new Grade 8/Class 10 hardware during installation regardless of visible condition, unless OEM explicitly allows reuse.\n‚Ä¢ Add a contamination control reminder: wipe and cap/plug both sides before opening, keep caps on until reconnection, and reject/flush any hose with visible contamination.\n‚Ä¢ Include a photo/checkpoint to confirm front support method on towables (hitched or front stands/cribbing) before any jack retraction.\n‚Ä¢ Reference specific Lippert documents for manual/service mode navigation (e.g., OneControl/LCI touch panel service menus) to improve usability.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ üö® MOTHER SAFETY CORRECTIONS: Emergency response procedures are missing. Add clear, actionable steps for: hydraulic injection injury (medical emergency‚Äîcall 911 immediately; do not delay treatment; no ice or tourniquet; take SDS), crush injury (do not attempt lift; call 911), eye/skin exposure to ATF and solvents (flush eyes 15 minutes, remove contaminated clothing, seek medical attention), and fire response/evacuation beyond having an extinguisher., Eyewash capability is not specified. Provide immediate access to an ANSI-compliant eyewash (or at minimum a portable eyewash bottle) when using brake cleaner/solvents and working with hydraulic fluids; reference OSHA 1910.151(c)., PPE set is incomplete for material handling. Add safety-toe footwear and cut-resistant/impact-rated work gloves for handling the 30‚Äì60 lb jack and sharp edges. Consider a face shield when cracking fittings under potential residual pressure and when wire brushing., Hearing protection is not addressed. Specify hearing protection when operating the hydraulic pump or power tools if noise may exceed safe levels (OSHA 1910.95)., LOTO of attached tow vehicle is not addressed. When a fifth wheel is hitched, remove and control the tow vehicle keys, apply a steering wheel tag \"Do Not Move‚ÄîPersonnel Working,\" and confirm transmission in Park and parking brake set to prevent movement., Solar/inverter backfeed hazard is not called out. If the RV has solar, isolate/cover PV panels and open any DC solar disconnects to prevent re-energizing 12V circuits; verify inverter/charger is de-energized per site LOTO., Ventilation and inhalation hazards for brake cleaner/solvents are not specified. Require use in well-ventilated areas, prohibit use of chlorinated brake cleaner near heat sources, and reference the product SDS; include respiratory protection criteria if ventilation is inadequate., Jack stand capacity and use criteria need strengthening. Specify stands must be rated for the anticipated share of vehicle weight with at least a 2:1 safety factor, used in pairs on solid, level concrete with hardwood cribbing; forbid cinder blocks; confirm saddle contact on straight frame rail only., Spill response escalation is not detailed. Add steps for spill containment, reporting thresholds, and disposal per local/state regulations; ensure a stocked spill kit is at hand., OSHA program references are not explicit. Call out compliance with: 1910.147 (LOTO program and training), 1910.132 (PPE hazard assessment and training), 1910.1200 (HazCom‚ÄîSDS available for ATF, Loctite 545, brake cleaner), 1910.22 (housekeeping/walking-working surfaces), and 1910.157 (portable fire extinguisher selection and training)., First-aid/communication is not defined. Specify how to contact emergency services, location of first-aid kit, and that at least one person on site is trained in first aid/CPR., No requirement to tag the leveling system and pump as out of service during LOTO. Add visible tags at the control panel and pump/motor area., No explicit instruction to verify zero energy at pump with a multimeter before opening the hydraulic circuit when unsure. Make this mandatory rather than optional \"if in doubt.\", Chemical compatibility of gloves is not specified. Note that some solvents degrade nitrile; mandate chemical-resistant gloves per SDS when using brake cleaner/solvents., Housekeeping/trip control could add cord/hose management. Require securing work lights/cords and routing hoses to avoid trip hazards per 1910.22., Add a stop-work criterion. Instruct techs to stop and re-stabilize if any frame movement is observed on stands, if the vehicle shifts, or if unexpected hydraulic motion occurs., Document requirement to keep ignition sources away from solvent use, and prohibit smoking/vaping in the work area., Consider adding a brief pre-task tailboard/JSA and signoff to confirm roles (lead/spotter), load path, support plan, and communication signals before lifting or retracting jacks.\n‚Ä¢ üß† FATHER LOGIC CORRECTIONS: Scope clarification: Lippert 'Level-Up' is primarily a 6-point hydraulic system on towables (fifth wheels). Many motorhomes use Lippert/Power Gear hydraulic leveling but not the 'Level-Up' product. Either limit scope to towables, or explicitly state that for motorized RVs this SOP applies to Lippert hydraulic rear jacks of similar construction and that controller/manifold layouts may differ., Jack stand capacity: 6-ton stands may be insufficient for large Class A motorhomes. Specify stands rated for the load at the support point (often 12‚Äì20 ton per stand on motorhomes) and require calculation/selection based on GVWR and support location., Reservoir handling: Add a step to clean around the reservoir cap and breather before opening, then crack the cap slowly to avoid drawing in debris. Confirm the breather is functional before testing., Dual-acting hose mapping: For powered-retract cylinders, explicitly mark and photograph 'extend' vs 'retract' hoses and ports to avoid cross-connection. Verify correct direction on first short stroke., Bleed stroke size: Start with shorter strokes (3‚Äì4 inches) for initial bleed to minimize load shifts while on stands; increase to 6‚Äì8 inches only if the coach remains stable., NPT sealant cure: In Procedure H, add 'Do not pressure-test NPT joints until Loctite 545 has reached fixture time (longer if <60¬∞F). If immediate testing is required, keep pressure low and recheck after full cure.', Typical fitting torque references: The listed 'typical' torques are on the high side. Consider updating references to common industry ranges to reduce over-torque risk (examples: -6 JIC 18‚Äì22 ft-lb, -8 JIC 30‚Äì45 ft-lb, -6 ORB 16‚Äì20 ft-lb), while still deferring to manufacturer charts., Underbelly reassembly: Add a step to reinstall and secure any coroplast/underbelly panels or shields removed for access, confirming hoses/looms are not pinched., Stand removal sequencing: Before zero-point calibration or Auto Level, add an explicit step to remove all temporary stands/cribbing and return the coach to its normal supports (tires/landing gear). Do not calibrate while the frame is loaded on stands., Air suspension note: For motorhomes, state 'dump air before placing stands and do not reinflate airbags until stands/cribbing are removed' to prevent body height changes during testing., Front support language (towables): In Section B.2, simplify and emphasize: 'Never use Retract All if front landing gear are providing the only front support. Establish front-frame stands or remain hitched before any retraction.', Footpad check: Add a check that the footpad orientation/pivot is correct and clears structure at full retract. If the footpad is bolt-on, torque its hardware per OEM spec., Manifold coil verification: Expand Section H.4 to include verifying correct coil-to-jack mapping after reconnection and clearing any controller fault codes before functional testing., Contamination control: Add 'Do not stuff rags into open hoses/ports. Use proper caps/plugs only. If a hose interior is contaminated or shows corrosion/damaged flare, replace the hose rather than reuse.', Post-test removal of supports: After successful functional test and final leak check, explicitly instruct to lower the frame off stands, remove stands/cribbing, and re-verify final fluid level with all jacks safely retracted., Troubleshooting addition: If the replaced jack creeps down after retract, suspect valve leakage/debris at the manifold or incorrect hose mapping on dual-acting systems; perform valve service per Lippert manual.\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SOP REGENERATED with Mother/Father corrections applied\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:04:44.476Z"},"sha256":"2529c0c82c1f933e4812ae9d73b2594482fb96ed56bcf2777a82488c698c3971"}

Photograph the shroud and data label if accessible. Capture model/serial for OEM bulletin/recall check. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Shroud and nameplate.\n2) Power down sources and prepare LOTO:\n   - Turn the thermostat OFF. If battery-powered, remove thermostat batteries or confirm hard OFF.\n   - At RV panel, switch OFF the AC breaker for the unit.\n   - Unplug shore power or shut down generator; open/lock any external disconnects.\n   - Turn house battery disconnect to OFF.\n   - Disable inverter output and place inverter in OFF; apply lockout/tagout on inverter output if possible.\n   - Disable/lock out automatic generator start (AGS).\n   - Open/lock PV breakers/fuses and/or cover solar panels with opaque covers to prevent charging/backfeed to 12 VDC controls.\n   - If serviceable, open/lock transfer switch to isolate sources.\n   - Apply personal locks/tags at each isolation device; use group LOTO/lockbox where multiple workers are involved. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: LOTO/tags and device positions.\n3) Verify zero energy:\n   - Try-start test: Attempt to start the AC from the thermostat to confirm no operation, then return controls to OFF.\n   - At the interior return grille, remove the grille/filter. Open the AC control box cover. Using a meter, verify absence of hazardous voltage between hot-neutral and hot-ground (AC) and verify 0 VDC/control power as applicable. Keep one hand behind back while probing.\n   - Proceed to roof (Section B) to verify absence of hazardous voltage at the rooftop unit supply terminals before any roof-side electrical contact. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Meter indicating verified absence of hazardous voltage (no hazardous reading) at interior control box.\n4) Discharge capacitors: Identify run/start capacitors. Use the insulated resistor across terminals for 30‚Äì60 seconds (C-to-FAN and C-to-HERM on dual caps). Verify residual voltage is dissipated. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Resistor connected during discharge.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_TITLE: Roof Access, Shroud Removal, and Initial Inspection\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_STEPS:\n1) Roof access: Set ladder on firm, level ground; maintain 4:1 angle; extend 3 ft above eave; secure base and top; assign a spotter. Barricade the drop zone below. Don PFAS where required; tether tools and secure a protective mat for staging tools.\n2) Inspect and remove shroud: Note cracks, missing hardware, UV damage. Remove perimeter screws using hand tools or a drill with a low-torque clutch; ensure screw length matches OEM to avoid coil puncture. Lift shroud straight up; avoid snagging fins. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Unit with shroud removed.\n3) Verify zero energy at rooftop unit: Before touching any rooftop electrical components, open the rooftop electrical/control enclosure and verify absence of hazardous voltage at the unit‚Äôs supply terminals using a meter. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Meter indicating verified absence of hazardous voltage at rooftop supply.\n4) Dry debris removal and visual check: Vacuum leaves/insects from base pan and coils. Inspect condenser fins for debris/bent areas, oil stains (possible refrigerant leak), corrosion. Inspect motors/fans for play/cracks; wiring for brittleness/chafe/rodent damage; note presence of soft-start modules and ECM motors. Inspect rooftop foam baffles/top gaskets that separate condenser intake from hot discharge; repair/replace to prevent hot-air recirculation. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Close-ups of damage, bent fins, oil stains, and any deteriorated baffles/seals.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_TITLE: Condenser Side Service (Roof)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_STEPS:\n1) Dry cleaning: Vacuum and brush condenser fins vertically to remove loose debris. For MCHE coils, use only a soft brush and low-pressure rinse‚Äîdo not use fin combs.\n2) Fin straightening (conventional fin-tube coils only): Use a fin comb to gently restore airflow paths; work from good fins into damaged zones. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Bent-fin section before/after.\n3) Wet cleaning:\n   - Mask open electricals, ECM motor modules, and soft-starts.\n   - Select an OEM-approved cleaner compatible with the coil (neutral pH only for aluminum/microchannel; never strong alkaline or acid on MCHE). Apply per SDS.\n   - Rinse with low-pressure water in the direction opposite normal airflow. For most RV rooftop units that draw air through side condenser coils and discharge upward, rinse from the inside-out to flush debris outward. Always confirm with OEM literature. Do not use pressure washers.\n   - Capture/contain runoff; prevent streaking on RV exterior; comply with local stormwater rules. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Rinse water running clear at coil base.\n4) Fan and motor inspection: Spin by hand; verify smooth rotation and no scraping. Check hub/set screw per OEM; confirm no radial play. Inspect wiring insulation. Do not spray water/cleaners into motor vents or ECM end bells. Apply dielectric grease only to seal boots/housings if OEM permits; do not coat mating spade surfaces. Note: Most blower/condenser motors are permanently lubricated‚Äîdo not oil unless OEM specifies. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Fan hub/set screw area.\n5) Mounts and vibration: Inspect compressor and fan/motor mounts, rubber grommets, and isolators; replace if cracked, missing, or degraded.\n6) Dry-out: Allow all cleaned components to air dry completely before re-energizing. Use gentle air flow if necessary; do not use high pressure that could drive water into electronics.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_TITLE: Roof Gasket, Mounting, and Shroud\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_STEPS:\n1) Gasket inspection: Inspect basepan-to-roof interface for compression and water trails. From inside, locate the four mounting bolts and assess gasket compression. New gaskets are typically ~1.0‚Äì1.25\" thick; expected compressed thickness is approximately 50% of original thickness when properly torqued. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Ruler at gasket edge.\n2) Torque mounting bolts: Using an inch-pound torque wrench, snug bolts in a cross pattern to OEM spec. If unknown, 40‚Äì50 in-lb is a common range. Tighten in small increments to achieve even compression (~50% of the measured new gasket thickness) without distorting the basepan. Do not over-compress.\n3) Gasket replacement (if needed): With a helper, support/lift unit, remove old gasket, clean surfaces, place new gasket square, lower carefully, torque as above. Do not apply sealant unless OEM directs. After installation, plan to recheck torque after 24 hours of compression set/thermal cycling (per OEM practice). PHOTO CHECKPOINT: New gasket positioned before lowering unit.\n4) Shroud service and reinstallation:\n   - Clean shroud. Replace if structural cracks are present.\n   - For minor non-structural hairline cracks, stabilize only with OEM-approved UV-resistant sealant if replacement is not immediately available.\n   - Use correct-length screws and flat/rubber washers to prevent cracking and avoid coil puncture; repair stripped bosses with approved inserts/epoxy as needed.\n   - Keep the shroud OFF until brief live rotation/amp verification in Section F. After that brief check, reinstall shroud per OEM. If torque is not specified, hand-snug using a low clutch setting; avoid overtightening especially on aged/brittle plastic. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Reinstalled shroud with all fasteners present.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_TITLE: Evaporator Side Service (Interior)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_STEPS:\n1) Access evaporator and blower: Remove interior plenum cover/dividers to expose evaporator coil and blower housing (commonly 5/16\" fasteners). PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Before photo of evap face and blower.\n2) Protect electricals: Mask control boards, wiring, thermostat/control modules, and any ECM motor modules with painter‚Äôs tape and plastic. Place absorbent towels/pans beneath to protect interior finishes. Assign an interior spotter during wet work.\n3) Verify and clear drains first: Identify and clear weep holes/drain paths with a small brush or low-pressure air limited to 30 psi with chip guarding. Verify flow before applying any cleaner to prevent overflow and interior drips. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Cleared weep/drain path.\n4) Dry cleaning: Vacuum return cavity, blower intake, and coil surface with soft brush in fin direction; avoid crushing fins. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Dry-cleaned coil surface.\n5) Blower wheel cleaning: Brush and vacuum each vane while holding the wheel. If heavily impacted, remove per OEM and wash with mild detergent; keep water out of motor housings; dry thoroughly before reinstall.\n6) Evaporator coil cleaning: Apply OEM-approved, neutral pH, self-rinsing evaporator cleaner top-to-bottom with light, even coverage. Allow dwell per SDS. Wipe excess with microfiber to minimize runoff; use absorbent pads to catch drips. Avoid overspray into electricals and ECM modules. In low humidity or limited condensate conditions, lightly rinse with low-pressure clean water per SDS to avoid residue. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Cleaner foaming on coil.\n7) Disinfect: Use only EPA-registered disinfectants labeled for HVAC coils/pans. Follow label contact time and rinse/no-rinse directions; avoid residue-forming products unless OEM-approved.\n8) Freeze/defrost and other sensors: Verify evaporator freeze sensor/thermistor is clipped mid-height with good coil contact; secure if loose per OEM (e.g., small zip tie). For heat pump models, verify/secure condenser/ODT/defrost sensors in OEM locations.\n9) Seal air leaks: Seal divider baffles and duct joints with UL 181 foil tape or butyl mastic to prevent return/supply bypass. Ensure airtight return/supply separation. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Sealed baffle joints.\n10) Dry-out: Allow interior components to dry fully before restoring power.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_TITLE: Electrical Inspection and Testing\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_STEPS:\n1) Grounding/bonding and terminations (de-energized):\n   - Verify equipment grounding conductor is present and securely bonded to the unit chassis.\n   - Perform a continuity/low-ohm check between chassis and equipment grounding conductor to confirm a solid bond.\n   - Inspect ground and neutral terminations for looseness or heat discoloration; torque/repair strictly to OEM/label values using a torque screwdriver/wrench; do not guess.\n   - Check strain reliefs and wire routing; replace brittle insulation; secure with UV-rated ties.\n2) Capacitors (de-energized): Discharge capacitors immediately before disconnecting leads (even if previously discharged). Disconnect leads noting positions (photograph). Measure capacitance. Acceptance criteria: use the tolerance printed on the capacitor label. Typical guidance: run capacitors ¬±5‚Äì6% of nameplate; start capacitors commonly +10% to +20% / ‚àí0%. Replace with same ¬µF and equal/higher VAC rating if out of spec, bulged, or leaking. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Meter reading with rating label visible.\n3) Prepare for live tests: Confirm all wet areas are fully dry. Remove only necessary locks for authorized live testing. Conduct NFPA 70E hazard/arc-flash assessment; don arc-rated PPE, Class 0 rubber gloves with leather protectors; use insulated tools and shrouded probes. Assign a safety watch if required.\n4) Voltage checks: Measure and record source/pedestal voltage (if accessible), RV main panel voltage, and unit supply voltage. Start cooling and measure unit voltage under load. Acceptance range is based first on the unit‚Äôs nameplate. For nominal 120 V systems, ANSI C84.1 Range A is 114‚Äì126 V and is preferred. Values in 108‚Äì132 V are considered non-preferred and must be investigated (cord length, transfer switch, breakers, wiring). Investigate voltage drop >3‚Äì5% from source to unit. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Live voltage under load (meter with leads visible).\n5) Current draw and brief shroud-off rotation check: With the shroud still off, briefly start the system to verify condenser fan rotation/direction and observe for rubbing or abnormal vibration. Limit runtime to a brief verification due to altered airflow/overheat risk. Clamp compressor and fan leads; compare running amps to nameplate and OEM data. If meter supports it, capture compressor inrush (LRA/inrush) for trending. After verification, de-energize, reinstall the shroud, reapply locks as needed, then proceed to extended operation testing in Section H.\n6) Optional insulation test (compressor only, if OEM allows): Power off and discharge capacitors. Disconnect and isolate compressor terminals from all wiring and disconnect any soft-start/start kits or electronic devices. Do not megger ECM motors or electronic modules. Megger between compressor terminals and ground at 250‚Äì500 V per OEM; typically >100 MŒ© is healthy; <2 MŒ© indicates concern‚Äîescalate. Allow any moisture to dry before reconnection.\n7) Soft-start devices: Identify presence and verify wiring per OEM/kit instructions. Follow manufacturer test procedures. Disconnect before any insulation testing.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_TITLE: Airflow, Ducting, and Filters\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_STEPS:\n1) Filter service: Clean OEM foam filters with warm soapy water, dry fully, or replace with OEM/cut-to-fit foam that seals without restricting airflow. Avoid high-static pleated filters that can starve airflow.\n2) Duct inspection: Inspect supply ducts/registers for crushed sections or loose joints. Reseat registers; seal leaks with UL 181 tape. Ensure airtight return/supply separation.\n3) Airflow verification (recommended): Use anemometer at a representative register to estimate CFM (area √ó velocity) or perform a smoke test to check for return bypass. Record results.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_TITLE: Functional Test and Performance Verification\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_STEPS:\n1) Reassemble interior plenum: Remove masking; reinstall baffles/covers/grille with snug fasteners. Verify divider seals remain intact.\n2) Restore power and start AC (cooling): Remove LOTO for operation. Thermostat Cool, fan High. Allow 10‚Äì15 minutes for stabilization; observe for abnormal noise/vibration. Confirm evaporator blower is delivering to supply ducts and return/supply separation is maintained.\n3) Fan rotation/airflow direction: Verify condenser fan airflow is correct per OEM (airflow through the condenser in the intended direction) and that fan blade orientation/pitch is correct.\n4) Cooling delta-T: Place probes at return (just upstream of filter) and a central supply register. Typical target 15‚Äì22¬∞F, dependent on indoor RH/ambient. Record ambient temperature/humidity. Avoid cooling performance testing below ~60¬∞F outdoor ambient unless using OEM-approved low-ambient procedures to prevent nuisance freeze-up. PHOTO CHECKPOINT: Return and supply temperature readings with locations.\n5) Condensate: Verify drainage to roof/path without interior drips; check ceiling/plenum for dryness; spotter confirms no leaks during wet cleaning and operation.\n6) Final electrical check (cooling): Verify stabilized amperage within limits; confirm thermostat cycles correctly; ensure no nuisance trips. Correlate amperage with voltage under load; if voltage is outside 114‚Äì126 V (Range A) or drops >3‚Äì5%, investigate and advise.\n7) Heat pump checks (if equipped and ambient allows):\n   - Note ambient limits: Many RV heat pumps lock out or perform poorly below ~40‚Äì45¬∞F. Verify heating performance only within OEM ambient limits.\n   - Verify reversing valve coil operation per OEM (some energize in cooling, some in heating). Command mode changes and listen/feel for valve shift.\n   - Test heating mode; allow 10‚Äì15 minutes to stabilize. Check supply temperature rise above return (magnitude depends on ambient; record values).\n   - Observe defrost initiation/termination behavior if conditions trigger it; note any steam/vapor and proper condensate handling.\n   - Return to cooling and confirm valve shifts back correctly.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_I_TITLE: Cleanup, Documentation, and Customer Communication\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_I_STEPS:\n1) Cleanup: Remove masking, pads, and debris; wipe cleaner residue; leave roof/interior clean. Remove any runoff controls; ensure no chemical discharge to stormwater. Remove barricades and restore site.\n2) Documentation: Record and attach photos of shroud/nameplate, before/after coil/blower, gasket measurement, fin straightening, live voltage under load, capacitor readings, and temperature readings. Log:\n   - Source/pedestal, main panel, and unit voltages (no-load and under load), and any % voltage drop; note whether within 114‚Äì126 V (preferred Range A) or outside.\n   - Running amperage (compressor/fan) and any inrush/LRA trending captured.\n   - Capacitor ¬µF and tolerances vs label; confirmation of re-discharge prior to testing.\n   - Delta-T (cooling; and heating if applicable), ambient temp/RH.\n   - Torque notes and gasket compressed thickness vs new; note re-torque plan after 24 hours if gasket replaced.\n   - Airflow estimates/smoke test observations (if taken).\n   - Grounding/bonding inspection results, including continuity/low-ohm check.\n   - Presence/configuration of soft-start devices and ECM motors.\n   - Coil cleaners/disinfectant products used (brand, pH/compatibility) and SDS conformance.\n   - Any mounts/grommets replaced; shroud fastener condition and screw length verification.\n   - Rooftop baffles/seals recirculation barrier condition/actions.\n   - OEM bulletin/recall check results for the model/serial.\n   - LOTO devices used, sources isolated (shore/gen/inverter/AGS/PV), and verification steps (try-start and instrument checks).\n3) Customer briefing: Review findings, actions taken, parts replaced, and recommendations (e.g., gasket replacement timeline, duct repairs, voltage management/power protection, shroud replacement, soft-start evaluation, rooftop baffle/seal repairs). Obtain approvals for any follow-up. Provide safety advisories if supply voltage routinely falls outside 114‚Äì126 V.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING_ISSUES:\n- Low cooling capacity/warm air: Dirty coils, airflow restriction, return/supply bypass, hot-air recirculation at condenser, low supply voltage (relative to nameplate and ANSI C84.1), weak run capacitor, incorrect fan rotation. Action: Clean coils with correct cleaner and rinse direction (inside-out for most, per OEM), service filters, seal baffles/ducts, repair rooftop recirculation seals, verify voltage under load vs nameplate; prioritize 114‚Äì126 V (Range A). Investigate source-to-unit voltage drop >3‚Äì5%. Test/replace capacitor, verify fan rotation/blade orientation, verify delta-T.\n- Evaporator freeze-up: Dirty filter/coil, low airflow, mispositioned freeze sensor, low ambient operation, low voltage. Action: Restore airflow, clean coils, position sensor mid-coil, use fan High, verify voltage; fully defrost; avoid low-ambient cooling without OEM procedure.\n- Water dripping inside: Over-compressed/degraded gasket, blocked drain/weep holes, unit not level, return/supply leak. Action: Clear drains first, verify level, torque/replace gasket to approximately 50% compression of new thickness, seal divider leaks.\n- Breaker trips on startup: Weak start/run capacitor, start device/soft-start fault (e.g., PTCR), dirty/rubbing fan, low voltage, wiring fault. Action: Test/replace capacitors/start device per label tolerances, clean/realign fan, verify voltage quality (prefer Range A), inspect wiring; if compressor LRA abnormal or suspected winding fault, escalate (no refrigerant work under this SOP).\n- Loud/unusual noise: Cracked shroud, loose mounting bolts, rubbing fan, debris in blower, failing bearings, degraded mounts/grommets, condenser recirculation baffles missing. Action: Replace shroud if structural, torque bolts, realign blade, clean blower, assess motor, replace mounts/grommets, restore baffles/seals.\n- Musty odor: Biofilm on evaporator/blower, dirty drain pan. Action: Clean/disinfect evaporator, blower, pan with HVAC-labeled disinfectant; improve filter maintenance; consider OEM-approved mitigations.\n- Fan runs, compressor does not: Failed compressor capacitor, open overload, wiring/control fault, soft-start fault. Action: Discharge and test capacitor to label tolerance; check overload continuity; verify control signal and 120 VAC to compressor; if open/grounded compressor suspected, isolate and test per OEM; escalate to repair SOP.\n- Short cycling: Thermostat sensing error (including battery issues), return/supply bypass, freeze sensor issue, control/soft-start issue, low-voltage trips. Action: Remove/replace thermostat batteries or confirm OFF when locking out; correct sensor location, seal divider, verify freeze sensor, review control operation, address voltage issues.\n\nMAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE:\n- Interior filter: Inspect monthly during cooling season; clean/replace as needed.\n- Evaporator coil and blower: Clean every 6‚Äì12 months; more often in dusty/high-pollen areas.\n- Condenser coil: Clean every 6‚Äì12 months; additionally after cottonwood/insect season. Use OEM-approved neutral pH cleaner for aluminum/MCHE; rinse low-pressure opposite airflow (typically inside-out).\n- Capacitors: Test annually; replace when outside label tolerance or if bulged/leaking.\n- Electrical connections: Inspect annually; torque to OEM/label values; verify grounding/bonding and continuity.\n- Roof gasket and mounting bolts: Inspect/torque annually; replace gasket every 3‚Äì5 years or when leakage/excess compression observed; target ~50% compression of new thickness; recheck torque ~24 hours after gasket replacement.\n- Ducting and baffles: Inspect/seal annually, including rooftop condenser recirculation seals/baffles.\n- Performance check (delta-T in cooling and heat where applicable, amps, voltage under load): At season start and mid-season in hot climates; avoid low-ambient cooling tests unless OEM procedure is used; prioritize Range A voltage.\n- Shroud condition: Inspect annually; replace if cracked.\n- OEM bulletin check: At each service, check for applicable service bulletins/recalls/kit updates.\n\nREFERENCED_DOCUMENTS:\n- RVIA Certified Technician Training Manual, Chapter 7 (RV Air Conditioning).\n- OEM service literature for applicable rooftop AC/heat pump units (Dometic, Coleman-Mach, Furrion, etc.).\n- NEC (NFPA 70), Article 551 (RVs) and Article 440 (AC equipment).\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147 (The control of hazardous energy/LOTO).\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.151(c) (Medical services and first aid, eyewash).\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.242(b) (Compressed air for cleaning).\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 (Respiratory protection).\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S (Electrical) and 1926 Subpart M (Fall Protection).\n- NFPA 70E (Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace).\n- ANSI C84.1 (Electric Power Systems and Equipment ‚Äì Voltage Ratings).\n- EPA Clean Air Act Section 608 (Refrigerant handling) for escalation cases.\n- UL 1995/CSA C22.2 No. 236 equipment safety standards.\n- SDS for cleaners/disinfectants used.\n\nDEFINITIONS_TERMS:\n- Delta-T: Temperature difference between return and supply air; indicator of cooling or heating performance.\n- FPI: Fins per inch; used to select fin comb on conventional fin-tube coils.\n- PSC/ECM: Motor types used for blower/fan operation. ECM motors contain sensitive electronics.\n- Run/Start capacitor: Capacitors for motor running performance and starting torque; rated in ¬µF and VAC with label tolerances.\n- RLA/FLA/LRA: Rated load amps/full load amps/locked rotor amps.\n- LOTO: Lockout/tagout; control of hazardous energy per OSHA 1910.147.\n- HERM: Hermetic compressor terminal on dual capacitors.\n- MCHE: Microchannel heat exchanger; flat tube condenser technology; do not fin-comb; sensitive to harsh chemicals.\n- Self-rinsing coil cleaner: Evaporator cleaner designed to drain with condensate; may require light water rinse in low humidity.\n- Weep holes: Drain openings for condensate in the pan.\n- Range A (ANSI C84.1, nominal 120 V): Preferred utilization voltage 114‚Äì126 V.\n- AGS: Automatic Generator Start.\n- PV: Photovoltaic (solar) system; includes panels and charge controller.\n\nCRITICAL NOTES:\n- Always defer to OEM specifications where they differ from this SOP.\n- Do not open or attach service equipment to the refrigerant circuit as part of this preventive maintenance. Escalate refrigeration diagnostics/repairs to an EPA 608-certified procedure. Never vent refrigerant.\n- Apply LOTO to all potential energy sources including shore, generator, inverter, AGS, transfer switch, battery, and PV/charge controller. Perform both try-start and instrument verification of de-energization. Verify absence of hazardous voltage at both interior control box and rooftop unit supply terminals.\n- Use an insulated resistor, not a screwdriver, to discharge capacitors; re-discharge immediately before capacitance testing.\n- Do not megger ECM motors or any electronic modules. Isolate the compressor and disconnect all electronics before any OEM-approved insulation test.\n- Use only OEM-approved, coil-type-compatible cleaners; for microchannel/aluminum, use neutral pH, non-acid, non-caustic cleaners. Rinse low-pressure opposite normal airflow (typically inside-out). Prohibit pressure washers.\n- Confirm drains are clear before applying self-rinsing cleaners; use compressed air ‚â§30 psi with chip guarding if needed.\n- Allow full dry-out before re-energizing after wet cleaning.\n- Gasket compression: Torque per OEM (commonly 40‚Äì50 in-lb) to approximately 50% of the measured new gasket thickness; avoid under- or over-compression; recheck torque after 24 hours when replaced.\n- Voltage acceptance: Nameplate governs. For nominal 120 V, prioritize ANSI C84.1 Range A (114‚Äì126 V). Treat 108‚Äì132 V as non-preferred and investigate.\n- When checking fan rotation with the shroud off, limit runtime to brief verification only due to altered airflow/overheat risk.\n- Use NFPA 70E-compliant energized work practices and PPE for any live testing. Use IEC 60900 insulated tools near energized parts.\n- Replace ‚Äú0.0 V‚Äù requirement with ‚Äúverified absence of hazardous voltage‚Äù to account for ghost/induced voltages in documentation.\n\n---\n\n**üìä ARBITRATION NOTES:**\n‚Ä¢ Roof gasket compression target is inaccurate. The SOP states new gasket ~1‚Äì1.25 in with a typical compressed target ~0.8 in; most OEMs specify tightening to 40‚Äì50 in-lb with the gasket compressed to roughly 50% of original thickness (~0.5‚Äì0.6 in for a 1‚Äì1.25 in gasket). Using 0.8 in as a target risks under-compression and leaks.\n‚Ä¢ Condenser cleaner guidance may damage some coils. Recommending an alkaline foaming cleaner without an explicit OEM/microchannel caveat can etch aluminum and damage microchannel (MCHE) coils. Cleaner selection must follow OEM and coil material guidance (often neutral pH, non-acid, non-caustic).\n‚Ä¢ Start capacitor tolerance listed as ¬±10% is not universally correct. Many start capacitors are +10% to +20% / ‚àí0% per label; run capacitors are typically ¬±5‚Äì6%. Using ¬±10% for start caps may prompt unnecessary replacements or miss out-of-spec parts.\n‚Ä¢ Voltage acceptance range is hard-coded to 103.5‚Äì126 VAC. That range applies to 115 V nameplate equipment (‚àí10%/+10%). Some RV AC units are marked 120 V; for 120 V nameplate the typical acceptable range is 108‚Äì132 VAC. Voltage criteria should be tied to the unit‚Äôs nameplate and ANSI C84.1.\n‚Ä¢ Insulation resistance (megger) testing can damage ECM motors, control boards, and soft-start modules if connected. The SOP says 'if OEM allows' but should explicitly instruct to disconnect all electronic devices/modules before megging and to avoid megging ECM motors.\n‚Ä¢ Refrigerant leak response language is ambiguous. 'Ventilate, evacuate as needed' could be misread as evacuating refrigerant. It should specify evacuate the area/personnel, not the refrigerant, and never vent refrigerant; escalate to EPA 608-certified service.\n‚Ä¢ Use of disinfectants on evaporator surfaces needs tighter control. Not all EPA-registered disinfectants are approved for HVAC evaporators or leave acceptable residues. Guidance should require products explicitly labeled for HVAC coil/pan use and follow rinse/no-rinse directions.\n‚Ä¢ Shroud screw torque of 10‚Äì15 in-lb may crack aged/brittle plastic. This should defer to OEM torque or direct use of a low clutch setting by feel; adding washers is good but overtightening risk remains.\n‚Ä¢ Dielectric grease on spade terminals can impede contact and trap heat if applied to mating surfaces. Even with the OEM caveat, guidance should restrict grease to environmental sealing of boots/housings and avoid the conductive interface unless explicitly directed by OEM.\n‚Ä¢ Wet coil cleaning on the roof risks interior water intrusion and slip hazards. The SOP mentions runoff control but should explicitly forbid pressure washers and require interior protection (towels/pans) and low-pressure rinsing only.\n‚Ä¢ Heat pump functionality is not verified. SOP scope includes heat pump variants, but functional tests only cover cooling. Missing steps to test heating mode, reversing valve operation, and defrost (if equipped) under suitable ambient conditions.\n‚Ä¢ ECM motor cleaning risks. The SOP does not explicitly warn to avoid spraying water/cleaners into ECM motor electronics or end-bells and to cover vents; moisture ingress can destroy ECM modules.\n‚Ä¢ Grounding integrity is not validated. There is no step to verify equipment grounding conductor continuity/bonding at the unit and to check for overheated/loose neutrals/grounds in the control box.\n‚Ä¢ Fan rotation/airflow direction verification is omitted. After reassembly, incorrect blade orientation or wiring changes can cause wrong airflow and poor performance; this should be explicitly checked.\n‚Ä¢ PROCEDURE_SECTION_D_STEPS item 3 incorrectly advises rinsing the condenser coil 'from inside out'. Best practice is to rinse in the opposite direction of normal airflow (from the outside in) to effectively flush trapped debris out of the coil instead of pushing it deeper.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Revise gasket guidance: state OEM-preferred method (torque all four bolts to 40‚Äì50 in-lb unless otherwise specified) and indicate the expected compression is approximately 50% of original gasket thickness. Remove the 0.8 in target or restate as a range tied to actual new gasket thickness.\n‚Ä¢ Restrict coil cleaner selection to OEM-approved products. Add explicit cautions for aluminum and microchannel coils: prefer neutral pH, non-acid, non-caustic cleaners; never use strong alkaline or acid on microchannel; always follow dwell/rinse per SDS and OEM.\n‚Ä¢ Update capacitor tolerances: Run capacitors typically ¬±5‚Äì6% of nameplate; start capacitors commonly +10% to +20% / ‚àí0% (or per label). Instruct techs to use the tolerance printed on the capacitor label as the acceptance criterion.\n‚Ä¢ Tie acceptable voltage range to the unit‚Äôs nameplate voltage and ANSI C84.1. Example: For 115 V nameplate: 103.5‚Äì126 V (‚àí10%/+10%); for 120 V nameplate: 108‚Äì132 V. Record source voltage and unit voltage under load and investigate voltage drop >3‚Äì5%.\n‚Ä¢ Megger procedure: Require disconnecting soft-start devices, start kits, control boards, and ECM motors before applying a megger. Do not megger ECM motors or electronic modules. State test voltage (250‚Äì500 V) per OEM and acceptable results; re-dry components before reconnection.\n‚Ä¢ Clarify refrigerant leak response: 'If a leak is suspected, ventilate the area, evacuate personnel if necessary, eliminate ignition sources, and escalate to an EPA 608-certified service. Do not attach gauges or vent refrigerant.'\n‚Ä¢ Disinfectant use: Specify only EPA-registered products labeled for HVAC evaporator/pan use. Follow contact time and rinsing instructions; avoid products that leave residues on coils unless OEM-approved.\n‚Ä¢ Add explicit prohibition on high-pressure washing of coils and shroud. Require low-pressure water from the inside out and mandate interior protection (absorbent pads/towels in the plenum) and a spotter to monitor for drips.\n‚Ä¢ Add heat pump checks: Verify reversing valve coil operation (energize/de-energize per OEM), test heating mode when ambient allows, listen for valve shift, check delta-T in heat mode, and note any defrost control behavior if equipped.\n‚Ä¢ Add ECM motor handling notes: Do not spray into motor housings or vents; cover ECM modules during cleaning; avoid megging ECM motors; keep connectors dry; allow complete drying before power-up.\n‚Ä¢ Add grounding/bonding verification: Inspect and tighten equipment ground connections; check continuity between unit chassis and RV ground; look for overheated/loose neutral/ground terminations.\n‚Ä¢ Add fan airflow verification: After reassembly, confirm condenser fan blows out through the condenser and evaporator blower delivers to supply ducts; verify blade orientation/pitch and correct motor rotation.\n‚Ä¢ Refine shroud fastener guidance: Defer to OEM torque; if unknown, use low clutch setting and hand snug only, particularly on aged shrouds. Consider rubber washers to reduce crack propagation.\n‚Ä¢ Expand voltage testing: Measure and record pedestal voltage (if accessible), RV main panel voltage, and unit voltage under load to localize voltage drop (pedestal cord, transfer switch, breaker, wiring).\n‚Ä¢ Add check for compressor/motor mounts and vibration isolators: Inspect rubber grommets and mounts; replace if degraded to reduce vibration and noise.\n‚Ä¢ Add OEM bulletin check: Capture model/serial and check OEM service bulletins/recalls/software updates for control kits or known gasket/shroud issues.\n‚Ä¢ Add low-ambient test note: Avoid cooling performance testing below ~60¬∞F outdoor ambient unless using OEM-approved low-ambient procedures (to prevent nuisance freeze-up and misleading delta-T).\n‚Ä¢ Add soft-start device notes: Identify presence of aftermarket/equipment soft-start modules; follow their test procedures; ensure wiring is correct; disconnect before insulation testing.\n‚Ä¢ Add environmental controls: Where local stormwater rules apply, use coil cleaner capture methods or perform rinse in a controlled wash area.\n‚Ä¢ Add ground-fault protection note: If receptacle/breaker is GFCI/ELCI, note potential nuisance trips during wet cleaning and ensure power is off and locked out prior to any wet work.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ üö® MOTHER SAFETY CORRECTIONS: Lockout/Tagout gaps: Add explicit disable/lockout steps for alternate energy sources common on RVs (inverter output, automatic generator start/AGS, and solar PV/charge controller). Verify zero energy after disabling these to prevent backfeed., LOTO verification: Include a try-start test (attempt to start the AC from the thermostat after locks are applied) in addition to meter checks to comply with best practice verification of de-energization., OSHA 1910.147 alignment: Explicitly reference and align the LOTO program with OSHA 1910.147, including use of personal locks/tags for each worker, group LOTO when applicable, and control of stored energy., Live electrical work PPE/practices: Require NFPA 70E-compliant energized work practices for any live testing (hazard/risk assessment, energized work authorization if applicable, arc-rated clothing/face shield, Class 0 rubber gloves with leather protectors, insulated tools, shrouded meter probes, approach boundaries, and one-hand rule)., Insulated tools: Mandate the use of voltage-rated insulated hand tools for any task near energized parts; currently not explicitly stated., Emergency response: Add a dedicated section detailing response for electrical shock (do not touch victim until de-energized; call 911; AED/CPR), falls from height, chemical eye/skin exposure (flush eyes/skin for at least 15 minutes; seek medical attention), heat illness, and refrigerant leak response (already partially covered). Include site emergency contacts and reporting requirements., Eyewash/first aid: Require readily accessible eyewash within 10 seconds of travel when using cleaners/disinfectants and a stocked first-aid kit/AED on site, per OSHA 1910.151(c)., Chemical spill/runoff control: Add spill response and waste handling procedures (absorbents/spill kit, labeled waste containers, disposal per local regulations). Explicitly prohibit mixing chemicals and require SDS on hand and reviewed before use (1910.1200)., Respiratory protection program: If a respirator may be needed per SDS, require OSHA 1910.134 compliance (medical evaluation, fit testing, training). Otherwise, state that only non-powered, well-ventilated methods are permitted to avoid respirator use., Compressed air safety: When using compressed air to clear drains, limit to 30 psi with effective chip guarding and mandatory eye protection, per OSHA 1910.242(b)., Fall protection specifics: Define when PFAS is mandatory (e.g., within 6 ft of an unprotected roof edge), anchorage strength (5,000 lb per worker or engineered), inspection and training requirements, and acceptable alternatives (guardrails/warning line systems). Add tool tethering and barricading the drop zone below., Ladder controls: Require ladder tie-off at the top when feasible, maintain the 4:1 angle, secure the base, and have a second person to stabilize/spot the ladder during ascent/descent., Dropped object prevention: Add requirement to tether tools and secure loose items on the roof to prevent struck-by hazards., Fire preparedness: Specify an accessible ABC fire extinguisher on site and control of ignition sources during live electrical testing and chemical use., Solar/inverter DC hazards: Note explicitly that solar PV can keep 12 VDC control circuits energized even with battery disconnect OFF; require covering panels or opening PV breakers/fuses and verifying 0 VDC at controls.\n‚Ä¢ üß† FATHER LOGIC CORRECTIONS: Improve workflow sequencing: Do all roof-side tasks in one visit (shroud removal, condenser cleaning, roof-side baffle/mount checks) before moving inside. Keep the shroud off until initial live rotation/amp checks are completed to avoid rework., Condenser rinse direction: Correct guidance to rinse opposite normal airflow, which for most RV rooftop units means rinsing from the inside-out. The current note \"typically from the outside in\" is likely incorrect‚Äîclarify per OEM., LOTO/backfeed completeness: Explicitly disable/lock out inverter output, auto‚Äëgen‚Äëstart, and transfer switch; isolate/cover solar PV or open the solar breaker/fuse so 12 VDC control power and AC backfeed cannot energize circuits., Evaporator drain order: Verify/clear pan weep holes and drain paths before applying self‚Äërinsing cleaner to prevent overflow and interior drips. Then clean, then disinfect., Microchannel caution: Do not use fin combs on MCHE coils; use only soft brush and low‚Äëpressure rinse. Limit fin‚Äëcomb use to conventional fin‚Äëtube coils., Dry-out before power: Add an explicit step to allow components to dry fully (or use gentle air) after wet cleaning before restoring power., Electrical terminations torque: State to torque lugs/spades strictly to OEM/label values using a torque screwdriver/wrench; do not guess if not published., Condenser recirculation seals: Inspect and repair rooftop foam baffles/top gaskets that separate condenser intake from hot discharge to prevent hot‚Äëair recirculation., Shroud fasteners: Specify using correct‚Äëlength screws and washers to avoid puncturing coils and to prevent cracking; repair stripped bosses as needed., Shroud-off testing caveat: If checking fan rotation with the shroud off, limit run time to a brief verification only due to altered airflow/overheat risk., Heat pump ambient limits: Note many RV heat pumps lock out or perform poorly below ~40‚Äì45¬∞F; only verify heating performance within OEM ambient limits., Voltage ranges nuance: Emphasize nameplate first; ANSI C84.1 Range A for 120 V is 114‚Äì126 V. Treat 108‚Äì132 V (Range B) as non‚Äëpreferred‚Äîinvestigate when observed., Capacitor safety: Reconfirm/discharge capacitors immediately before disconnecting leads for ¬µF testing in Section F, even if they were discharged earlier., Motor lubrication: Note most blower/condenser motors are permanently lubricated‚Äîdo not oil unless OEM specifies oil ports., Ground bond test: In addition to visual checks, perform a continuity/low‚Äëohm check between chassis and equipment grounding conductor., Thermostat power: If the thermostat is battery powered, remove batteries or ensure it is OFF; confirm some solar controllers can bypass the house disconnect and still feed 12 VDC controls., Zero‚Äëvoltage photo wording: Replace \"meter showing 0.0 V\" with \"verified absence of hazardous voltage\" to account for ghost/induced voltages., Self‚Äërinsing cleaner caveat: In low humidity, lightly rinse evaporator coil with water per SDS to avoid residue if condensate is insufficient., Sensor verification: For heat pump models, verify/secure both evaporator freeze and condenser/ODT/defrost sensors per OEM location guidance., Optional trending: If the meter supports it, capture compressor inrush (LRA/inrush) to trend starter/soft‚Äëstart health without opening the system., Re‚Äëtorque after set: After gasket replacement, recheck torque after 24 hours of compression set/thermal cycling, per OEM practice if applicable., Verify zero energy at rooftop unit: In addition to interior box, confirm 0 VAC at the unit‚Äôs supply terminals before rooftop work.\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SOP REGENERATED with Mother/Father corrections applied\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:27:44.692Z"},"sha256":"fdc4bec9117329786c7df7734c9b4fcad27285426ef96d1e83cee3af6e14145e"}

Use redundant, rated supports at OEM-documented points.\n- Primary depressurization: use Lippert manifold manual override/relief screws to open the serviced circuit to tank per model manual. Test ports are for measurement only. Return screws fully closed after use. Only crack a line if the primary method is unavailable and enhanced controls are in place; never loosen test ports or valve cartridges to bleed.\n- Do not apply sealant to JIC or ORB; only NPT uses approved anaerobic pipe sealant. Never use PTFE/Teflon tape on hydraulic fittings. Replace and lubricate ORB O-rings; keep JIC flare faces pristine.\n- Use only the fluid indicated by the system label/reservoir cap; do not mix fluids.\n- Always use backup wrenches on hydraulic fittings; avoid twisting hoses/manifolds. Avoid inverted U-traps that can trap air; route to allow air migration to reservoir.\n- Torque to Lippert/OEM and fitting manufacturer specifications; apply crowfoot correction unless at a true 90¬∞. No cheater bars/extensions for final torque on torque wrenches; if an effective-length extension is unavoidable, calculate correction accurately. Record values and tool IDs. If unknown, stop and obtain correct data. Always use new cotter pins.\n- Cleanliness is critical: cap/plug every open hydraulic connection immediately; use lint-free materials only.\n- Do not cut, flare, or fabricate hydraulic lines; replace with OEM assemblies only.\n- If cylinder/jack rod is scored/bent or the seal head/wiper is damaged, do not install‚Äîreturn/replace.\n- Remove conductive jewelry; secure clothing; protect finishes with fender covers.\n- Pressure equipment: Use gauges/tees/hoses/adapters rated above system max with minimum 4:1 safety factor. Tether hose-mounted gauges to prevent whip; stand clear during pressure holds. Remove gauges and cap ports after testing; record gauge ID and range.\n- Electrical isolation: Some HPUs bypass coach disconnects‚Äîphysically remove HPU fuse or lead and re-verify zero volts.\n- Waste and environment: Segregate used ATF/hydraulic fluid from other oils; label containers; do not commingle wastes.\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Correct cylinder/jack installed with verified dimensions/orientation; required adapters/restrictors transferred/or installed.\n- All fittings and hardware torqued per spec and marked; crowfoot correction applied when used; no torque wrench cheaters used for final torque.\n- Zero leaks at operating pressure and at rest; dry cardboard test passes.\n- Smooth, synchronous travel through 3‚Äì5 full cycles without binding/chatter; only serviced circuit cycled during bleed; hose routing free of air traps/chafe risks.\n- Reservoir at correct level; correct fluid used; breather functional; reservoir not opened unless authorized and cleanliness maintained if opened.\n- End-of-stroke pressure(s) recorded with gauge ID/range; gauge removed and port capped; motor stayed within duty cycle/temperature limits (caution <80¬∞C; hard stop <90¬∞C).\n- Travel locks/guards restored and adjusted; leveling controller zero-point/hitch-height calibration completed (if applicable).\n- LOTO performed with locks/hasps and released per procedure; AGS disabled/enabled appropriately.\n- Site clean; waste segregated/labeled; all documentation and photos complete and attached to work order.\n\nAPPENDIX A: Torque and Tooling Guidance (Reference Only‚ÄîVerify Against Current Lippert/SAE/Manufacturer Specs)\n- General:\n  - Use clean, calibrated torque wrenches. Note tool ID and calibration due date in records.\n  - Do not use handle/cheater extensions for final torque on torque wrenches. If an extension is unavoidable and changes effective length, calculate and apply correction.\n  - Crowfoot/extension correction (in-line orientation):\n    - Tsetting = Tdesired √ó L / (L + A)\n    - L = effective length of torque wrench (center of handle to drive), A = effective length of crowfoot/extension (center of drive to center of fastener).\n    - No correction only when the crowfoot is exactly at 90¬∞ to the wrench. If not exactly 90¬∞, apply correction.\n- Typical starting torque ranges (steel fittings; lubricated O-rings; ambient temp):\n  - JIC 37¬∞ flare (SAE J514) male to female:\n    - -4 (7/16-20): approx. 12‚Äì17 ft-lb (144‚Äì204 in-lb)\n    - -6 (9/16-18): approx. 18‚Äì26 ft-lb (216‚Äì312 in-lb)\n    - -8 (3/4-16): approx. 31‚Äì44 ft-lb\n    - -10 (7/8-14): approx. 45‚Äì62 ft-lb\n    - -12 (1-1/16-12): approx. 65‚Äì85 ft-lb\n  - ORB (SAE J1926) straight thread with O-ring:\n    - -4 (7/16-20): approx. 12‚Äì16 ft-lb\n    - -6 (9/16-18): approx. 18‚Äì22 ft-lb\n    - -8 (3/4-16): approx. 32‚Äì40 ft-lb\n    - -10 (7/8-14): approx. 45‚Äì55 ft-lb\n    - -12 (1-1/16-12): approx. 65‚Äì75 ft-lb\n  - NPT/NPTF (with anaerobic sealant; do not use on first 2 threads):\n    - General: Hand-tight + 1.5‚Äì3 turns. Do not over-torque; orient as needed using minimal additional turns. Inspect for thread engagement and leaks.\n- Always defer to Lippert/OEM specifications and fitting manufacturer data if values differ. If the exact spec is not available, stop and obtain the correct data before proceeding.\n\nAPPENDIX B: Pump/Motor Duty Cycle Guidance\n- Unless otherwise specified by Lippert for the model:\n  - Limit continuous HPU motor operation to 20‚Äì30 seconds ON, followed by at least 2‚Äì3 minutes OFF.\n  - Monitor motor housing temperature; caution at ~80¬∞C/176¬∞F; hard stop at ~90¬∞C/194¬∞F; monitor wiring/terminal temperature and condition.\n  - Symptoms of overheating include smell, discoloration, slowed motor speed; pause and allow full cool-down if observed.\n\nAPPENDIX C: Grade 8 Bolt/Nut Torque Reference (Reference Only‚ÄîVerify Against Lippert/OEM)\n- Dry torque, hex head bolts (approximate):\n  - 3/8-16: 44 ft-lb\n  - 7/16-14: 70 ft-lb\n  - 1/2-13: 105 ft-lb\n  - 9/16-12: 150 ft-lb\n  - 5/8-11: 210 ft-lb\n  - 3/4-10: 370 ft-lb\n- Lubricated torque typically 85‚Äì90% of dry values; follow OEM specs if provided.\n- Always use new cotter pins on pinned joints and OEM-specified locknuts where applicable.\n\nEND OF SOP\n\n---\n\n**üìä ARBITRATION NOTES:**\n‚Ä¢ Energy isolation is incomplete: SOP does not explicitly require disconnecting/isolating all potential DC/AC backfeed sources (shore power, generator, solar charge controller, tow vehicle 7‚Äëpin/alternator on towables). Focus is on battery/pump only.\n‚Ä¢ Depressurization alternate method (cracking a cylinder port) is presented without explicit controls such as draping the joint with a heavy rag, using a remote extension on the wrench, and standing out of plane. Lippert manifold/manual override bleed should be the primary method.\n‚Ä¢ Leveling system scope ambiguity: Many Lippert leveling ‚Äòcylinders‚Äô are integral jack leg assemblies. SOP does not clarify that field service typically replaces the complete jack assembly rather than servicing an internal cylinder unless Lippert explicitly authorizes.\n‚Ä¢ No guidance on 12 V pump/motor duty cycle during bleeding and functional cycling. Extended jogs/cycling can overheat the motor and damage the pump.\n‚Ä¢ Torque control lacks concrete guidance/values and does not mention crowfoot torque correction for flare fittings; risk of under/over‚Äëtorque on JIC/ORB/NPT connections.\n‚Ä¢ Controls for unintended activation from interior switches/remotes are not explicit (tag/disable interior controls, keep occupants/pets clear).\n‚Ä¢ Minor safety omission: no reminder to remove conductive jewelry/watches when working around high‚Äëcurrent 12 V battery circuits.\n‚Ä¢ Cleaning note could be clearer that solvent should not be sprayed on seals, plastics, painted surfaces, or into open hydraulic ports.\n‚Ä¢ Slide room load management is implied but not explicit: no instruction to remove heavy items from the slide room to reduce load before supporting/servicing.\n‚Ä¢ No explicit mention to check for and manage slide travel locks/locking bars (remove before cycling; reinstall after).\n‚Ä¢ The 'DATE_CREATED' is set in the future (2025-08-31), which may be a typo or indicate this is a draft. This does not affect the validity of the procedure's content.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Expand LOTO/energy isolation: disconnect shore power and disable generator; cover/disable interior control panels; disconnect or isolate solar charging (pull fuse or cover panels) and verify no backfeed; on towables, unplug 7‚Äëpin from tow vehicle. Verify 0 V at pump after all sources are isolated.\n‚Ä¢ Make manifold/test‚Äëport depressurization the required primary method per Lippert manual. If cracking a line is unavoidable: ensure zero mechanical load and robust supports; wear face shield and gloves; stand out of spray plane; drape the joint with a thick rag; use a flare wrench with a handle extension to keep distance; loosen no more than needed; immediately cap/plug.\n‚Ä¢ Clarify leveling scope: for Lippert leveling systems, replace the complete jack leg assembly (with integral cylinder) unless a Lippert procedure explicitly authorizes cylinder‚Äëonly service. Include model‚Äëspecific references/part numbers.\n‚Ä¢ Add pump duty cycle guidance during bleed/testing: e.g., limit to 20‚Äì30 seconds ON followed by 2‚Äì3 minutes OFF (or per Lippert spec) to prevent motor overheating. Monitor motor temperature and wiring.\n‚Ä¢ Provide fitting torque references or an appendix/table for common JIC/ORB/NPT sizes used on Lippert systems. Instruct technicians to apply crowfoot torque correction (account for wrench length/offset) and to stop if the exact spec is unknown.\n‚Ä¢ Add explicit administrative controls: place Do Not Operate tags at interior slide/leveling switches and remote controls; establish an exclusion zone; announce before energizing; keep all personnel, customers, and pets clear.\n‚Ä¢ Add reminder to remove conductive jewelry/watches and secure loose clothing when working around batteries and rotating machinery.\n‚Ä¢ Enhance cleaning guidance: use solvent on external metal surfaces only; avoid seals, plastics, painted finishes, and never allow solvent into open hydraulic ports. Use lint‚Äëfree wipes only.\n‚Ä¢ Add slide room load management: remove heavy items from the slide, stow loose objects, and verify slide toppers/awnings or trim will not interfere before cycling.\n‚Ä¢ Call out slide travel locks: remove OEM travel locks/locking bars before movement and reinstall/verify after testing as part of restoring protective devices.\n‚Ä¢ Add note to verify and document clevis/jam‚Äënut torque (if adjustable rod end) per Lippert/OEM spec and to re‚Äëmeasure pin‚Äëto‚Äëpin after torque.\n‚Ä¢ Recommend using a manifold pressure gauge during leak check to record end‚Äëof‚Äëstroke pressure (helps validate relief setting and aids troubleshooting).\n‚Ä¢ Emphasize hose routing QA: specify minimum bend radius, twist check (lay line markings), and edge protection; trim zip‚Äëties flush to prevent sharp edges.\n‚Ä¢ Add instruction to verify reservoir breather cap is clean/functional and suction strainer (if equipped) is clear during refill.\n‚Ä¢ Include guidance for post‚Äëservice customer environment: advise recheck for leaks after first day of use and after first trip; reinforce scheduled torque re‚Äëcheck already listed.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ üö® MOTHER SAFETY CORRECTIONS: Emergency response procedures are missing: add explicit steps for hydraulic injection injury (treat as a medical emergency; do not delay; no tourniquet; transport to ER with SDS), eye/skin exposure to ATF and solvents (15-minute eyewash/flush; remove contaminated clothing), inhalation of solvent vapors, fire response/evacuation, and spill escalation with emergency contacts., Hazard Communication (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200) not addressed: require review and availability of SDS for ATF/hydraulic fluid and brake cleaner; pre-job briefing of chemical hazards; proper labeling of all containers including waste; employee HazCom training reference., Lockout/Tagout details incomplete for OSHA 1910.147 compliance: specify use of physical lockable devices (locks/hasps) on battery disconnect, generator start/auto-start, inverter/charger, solar breakers/charge controller, and HPU circuit; one-person/one-key policy; group LOTO process for two techs; verification ‚Äòtry‚Äô step; and formal release-from-LOTO sequence with area re-check and notification., Auto-generator start (AGS) not mentioned: require disabling AGS/auto-start features and tagging controls to prevent unintended generator start., Ventilation/respiratory controls for solvents missing: specify adequate ventilation when using non-chlorinated brake cleaner; prohibit use in confined or poorly ventilated areas; require respirator per SDS if ventilation is inadequate., Eyewash/first-aid access not specified: ensure an eyewash station (ANSI Z358.1) is available within 10 seconds travel when using solvents and hydraulic fluids; state location in the SOP., Fire safety details need enhancement: specify extinguisher rating (e.g., 2A:10B:C) and pre-use inspection (charged, pin/seal intact); explicitly note high flammability of non-chlorinated brake cleaner; prohibit use near hot surfaces and ignition sources; confirm personnel are trained in extinguisher use., Electrical safety refinements: add waiting period for inverter/charger capacitor discharge before verification; require insulated tools around batteries; state that protective terminal boots must be installed before re-energizing., Pressure test equipment rating not stated: require gauges, tees, hoses, and adapters to have working pressure at or above system maximum with a minimum 4:1 safety factor; tether or secure hose-mounted gauges to prevent whip., Ladder/elevated work controls absent: if accessing slide toppers/upper mounts, include OSHA 1910.23 ladder safety (stable footing, three points of contact, tie-off/spotter as applicable)., Torque with extensions: clarify that handle/cheater extensions must not be used on torque wrenches; use only for initial loosening/controlled venting, not for final torque to avoid inaccurate torque and loss of control., Training/competency documentation: add requirement to document technician training for hydraulic safety, cribbing/support, LOTO, PPE, and HazCom, with refresher intervals (OSHA 1910.147, 1910.132)., Housekeeping/slip-trip controls: add explicit requirement to manage hoses/cables to prevent trips and to immediately clean spills, placing wet floor signage as needed (OSHA 1910.22)., Battery/shore power testing controls: if shore power is reconnected for testing, require GFCI protection and confirm all AC/DC panels are closed with covers in place; keep bystanders clear., Mechanical support specification: define minimum WLL/rating for cribbing/jack stands and prohibit stacking unstable materials; require redundant supports and documented placement points from OEM literature., Post-incident reporting and stop-work authority: include directives to stop work on any unsafe condition, report incidents/near misses, and conduct corrective action review.\n‚Ä¢ üß† FATHER LOGIC CORRECTIONS: Clarify primary depressurization: use the Lippert manifold‚Äôs manual override/relief screws to open the serviced circuit to tank per the exact model manual; the test port is for measurement only and should not be used as a bleed path. Return manual override screws fully to their original (closed) position after depressurization., Specify pressure gauge range: use a gauge rated above the system relief pressure (recommend 0‚Äì5000 psi for leveling systems; 0‚Äì3000 psi may be insufficient on some models)., Prohibit PTFE/Teflon tape on all hydraulic fittings; use only approved anaerobic sealant on NPT threads where applicable., Add guidance for adjustable ORB elbows: lightly seat O-ring, orient the elbow to required position, then torque the lock/jam nut; do not orient JIC by backing off after torque., Add note on port adapters/restrictors: some Lippert cylinders use port adapters with orifices/checks. Identify and transfer required adapters/restrictors from the old unit to the new one, or obtain replacements per Lippert., Enhance single-acting jack safety: coil springs store energy. Ensure the jack is fully retracted/unloaded and the return path to tank is open before loosening plumbing or hardware; support the footpad/leg to control movement., Reservoir/strainer inspection: do not open the tank or disturb internal strainers unless the Lippert manual explicitly instructs; otherwise escalate. Maintain strict cleanliness if opening is authorized., Duty-cycle temperature limits: add a caution threshold at ~80¬∞C/176¬∞F and a hard stop at ~90¬∞C/194¬∞F on the motor housing; allow cool-down if near limits., Torque and hardware: include a Grade 8 bolt/nut torque reference (dry vs lubricated) for common mounting sizes or cite the exact Lippert/OEM torque table for jack upper bolts and slide cylinder pin retainers. Always use new cotter pins., Tooling caution: handle extensions/cheaters must not be used during final torque unless the effective length and correction are calculated. Prefer positioning for direct torque application., Crowfoot usage: emphasize that no correction applies only at a true 90¬∞ orientation; if not exactly 90¬∞, apply the correction formula., Add quick verification of hose mapping: after initial reconnection, perform a brief 1-second jog to confirm extend/retract direction before final dressing, with supports in place., Hose routing detail: avoid creating inverted U-traps that can trap air; maintain bend radius and favor routes that allow air to migrate back to the reservoir during bleeding., Bleeding scope control: cycle only the serviced circuit during bleed; ensure other manifold valves remain closed to prevent unintended movement., Leveling controller calibration: after jack leg replacement, perform Lippert zero-point calibration and re-teach hitch height as required by the specific control system., Travel lock/stop verification: after testing, verify travel locks/locking bars are correctly adjusted and engage/disengage smoothly; document settings if adjustable., Gauge handling: zero/verify the gauge before use, stand clear during pressure holds, then remove the gauge and cap the port after testing; record the gauge ID and range., Electrical isolation redundancy: note that some HPUs are wired directly to battery lugs; if the battery disconnect does not de-energize the HPU, physically remove the HPU fuse or power lead and re-verify zero volts., Recordkeeping enhancement: document manifold valve IDs/labels and A/B port mapping to cylinder base/rod ends with photos to aid future service and troubleshooting., Rod-end jam-nut torque technique: hold the clevis/rod end with a backup wrench to prevent rod rotation while torquing the jam-nut; record torque., Environmental note: used ATF/hydraulic fluid may be regulated differently than engine oil‚Äîstore and dispose separately per local rules; do not commingle wastes., Alternate depressurization step wording: when cracking a fitting is unavoidable, specify opening the circuit‚Äôs highest accessible point (relative to the cylinder) and limit movement to a controlled vent; never loosen test ports or valve cartridges to bleed., Wheel chock clarity: chock both sides of at least one axle (fore and aft) to prevent any vehicle movement during slide/jack service.\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SOP REGENERATED with Mother/Father corrections applied\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:30:36.089Z"},"sha256":"85acd5c6907b6ec74da28b7b29777abe55d0a8aea9d3c1f70b4e1e18a59d7cd9"}

Clarification: 30 A shore service is 120 V single-pole (NEMA TT-30). 50 A shore service is 120/240 V split-phase (NEMA 14-50; two 120 V legs, L1/L2).\n- Prevent injury, equipment damage, and misdiagnosis through rigorous Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) with locks where feasible, NFPA 70E energized work controls, correct test methods, pre-energization pedestal checks with acceptance ranges, and thorough documentation.\n- Expected outcomes: Root cause identified and verified; corrective actions implemented with listed/OEM-approved parts; updated labels; complete measurement records; verified system operation on all power sources (shore, generator, inverter); post-service safety devices verified.\n\nSCOPE_DETAILS:\n- Equipment covered: Winnebago motorhomes and towables, including:\n  - 12 VDC distribution; house batteries (Flooded/AGM/LiFePO4); converters; inverter/chargers; transfer switches; EMS/surge devices; GFCI/AFCI/dual-function circuits; DC loads (lights/fans/pumps); AC receptacles; 30 A 120 V single-pole and 50 A 120/240 V split-phase shore systems (L1/L2 only on 50 A).\n- Personnel: RVIA/NFPA-trained technicians or supervised apprentices. Any energized-panel or exposed-energized-conductor work requires NFPA 70E-qualified personnel, an Energized Electrical Work Permit (EEWP) when justified, and a second qualified person for rescue support.\n- Limitations: Excludes true 240 V appliance troubleshooting beyond distribution checks; engine electrical; lithium BMS internal repairs; board-level repairs of inverters/chargers/generators. Obtain OEM/warranty authorization before parts replacement. Do not enter permit-required confined spaces without a compliant program.\n\nSAFETY_SPECIAL_NOTES:\n- Lockout/Tagout (OSHA 1910.147):\n  - Use locks where feasible: plug lock for shore cord; breaker lockouts/hasps; lockable battery disconnects; inverter/charger and PV disconnect locks; generator starter battery disconnect lock. Implement group LOTO with a hasp when multiple persons are exposed; each person applies and removes their own lock; maintain LOTO log.\n  - If true lockout is not possible (e.g., campground pedestal lacking lock provision), implement a compliant tagout with additional measures: remove and retain control of the plug, install a plug lock if possible, post a dedicated attendant, apply prominent tags at all control points, verify de-energization, and document the justification in the job briefing/EEWP.\n- NFPA 70E energized work controls:\n  - Only when justified. Require EEWP, documented job briefing, shock/arc-flash risk assessment, established approach boundaries, and a second qualified person trained in CPR/AED and electrical rescue. Identify AED location and ensure reliable EMS access.\n  - Approach boundaries for 50‚Äì300 V: establish Limited Approach Boundary ‚âà1.0 m (3.5 ft); Restricted Approach is ‚ÄúAvoid Contact.‚Äù Install barricades/tape and post ‚ÄúDANGER ‚Äî ENERGIZED WORK‚Äù signage to keep unqualified persons out.\n  - PPE: Follow employer‚Äôs arc-flash assessment/labels. If no label, a conservative default for 120/240 VAC panel exposure is arc-rated clothing ‚â•8 cal/cm¬≤ (long-sleeve shirt/pants), arc-rated face shield with balaclava, Class 0 rubber insulating gloves with leather protectors, safety glasses, hearing protection, insulated tools, and insulated mat/blankets. Use one-hand technique; minimize exposure time.\n- Rubber insulating gloves:\n  - Class 0 (up to 1,000 V). Compliant with ASTM D120 and marked accordingly. Daily field air test and visual inspection before use; confirm dielectric test date within 6 months. Store cuffs up in glove bags away from ozone/UV; keep rubber and leather protectors separated when stored. If contaminated with battery acid, flush with water, wash with mild soap, dry thoroughly, and re-inspect; remove from service if any doubt remains.\n- Battery/arc/chemical hazard:\n  - Remove jewelry; cover adjacent terminals; disconnect negative first/reconnect last; use fused test leads; keep ABC (A:B:C) multipurpose dry chemical or CO2 extinguishers nearby; ventilate for hydrogen gas.\n  - Chemical PPE for flooded batteries: chemical splash goggles plus a face shield, acid-resistant gloves, and an acid-resistant apron when checking SG or watering. Ensure an eyewash station/portable eyewash is available within 10 seconds travel time.\n  - Lithium battery thermal event: If smoke/venting/fire is suspected, evacuate, call 911, do not attempt to fight a growing battery fire. If authority-approved and safe, cool surrounding exposures; do not use water on energized equipment.\n- HazCom (OSHA 1910.1200):\n  - Maintain Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for batteries/electrolyte, cleaners, anti-oxidant compounds, etc. Label any secondary containers. Train employees on chemical hazards and required PPE.\n- Thermal/fire hazard:\n  - Loose/high-resistance connections can overheat. Torque to spec; validate overcurrent protection/conductor size; perform thermal inspection after re-energizing. Use thermal imager when possible.\n- Solar backfeed/stored energy:\n  - Open PV disconnect/combiner; cover panels if needed. Verify ‚âà0 V at controller PV input.

Review prior service records.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Service history notes/customer statement.\n2. Safety walk-around:\n   - Inspect exterior/interior for damaged cords, burnt odors, heat/smoke signs, water intrusion, stability/level. Place wheel chocks. Verify housekeeping to prevent slips/trips.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Visible damage/hazards.\n3. Job briefing (document):\n   - Identify work location address/park name and lot number; verify communication method. Review hazards, LOTO points, rescue plan, AED location, and roles. Prohibit working alone for energized/confined tasks. If more than one worker, establish group LOTO.\n4. Identify all energy sources:\n   - Shore pedestal (30 A 120 V single-pole TT-30 or 50 A 120/240 V split-phase 14-50), generator, inverter/charger, solar PV, house/chassis batteries, transfer switch, EMS.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Each source identified.\n5. Pre-energize shore pedestal verification (before connecting RV):\n   - Visual: Inspect receptacle/cap, heat damage, loose contacts.\n   - Using TRMS DMM with receptacle adapter and appropriate PPE:\n     - Acceptance ranges (ANSI C84.1 Range A guidance): Accept 114‚Äì126 VAC per 120 V leg. Many EMS trip points ‚âà104‚Äì106 V low and ‚âà132 V high; do not connect if outside 114‚Äì126 VAC for initial testing.\n     - 30 A (TT-30): Hot‚ÄìNeutral 114‚Äì126 VAC; Hot‚ÄìGround 114‚Äì126 VAC; Neutral‚ÄìGround ‚âà0 VAC.\n     - 50 A (14-50): L1‚ÄìNeutral 114‚Äì126 VAC; L2‚ÄìNeutral 114‚Äì126 VAC; L1‚ÄìL2 ‚âà240 VAC; Neutral‚ÄìGround ‚âà0 VAC; L1‚ÄìGround 114‚Äì126 VAC; L2‚ÄìGround 114‚Äì126 VAC.\n   - Under-load verification (preferred): With a representative RV load applied later, confirm each 120 V leg remains ‚â•114 VAC at the pedestal and main panel.\n   - If faults (open neutral, reverse polarity, missing ground, low/high voltage) are found, do not connect; notify customer/park; document readings with photos.\n6. LOTO/de-energize sequence (use locks where feasible; group LOTO if applicable):\n   - Shore power: Turn pedestal breaker OFF; unplug; apply plug lock (TT-30/14-50) if feasible; apply lockout on pedestal breaker if permitted; tag. Maintain control of the disconnected shore plug.\n   - Generator: Stop; remove key; tag ‚ÄúDo Not Start‚Äù; disable AGS in controller; lock out generator starter battery via lockable disconnect or remove/lock a fused starter link; tag any remote start points; verify zero energy at generator output terminals.\n   - Inverter/charger: Power OFF; disconnect remote enable if present; apply lock to DC/AC disconnects if provided; wait 2‚Äì5 minutes for discharge (or OEM-specified).\n   - Solar PV: Open PV disconnect/combiner; apply lock; cover panels if necessary; verify ‚âà0 V at controller PV input.\n   - Batteries: Open/lock battery disconnects if installed; otherwise disconnect negative cable(s) first; insulate and tag. Isolate both house and chassis as applicable.\n   - Place LOTO tags and locks on all sources; record in LOTO log (group hasp if multiple workers).\n   - Tagout justification: If any source cannot be locked, implement tagout with additional measures and document justification in the job briefing/EEWP.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Locks/tags in place; pedestal OFF/unplugged; PV ‚âà0 V; battery negative removed/locked out; AGS disabled.\n7. Verify absence of voltage (AoV) per NFPA 70E:\n   - Prove the meter on a known live source; test the RV; re-prove on the live source.\n   - Observe OEM discharge wait times for capacitors in ATS/EMS/SPD and then test. If voltage is detected, wait longer and retest.\n   - AC at main panel/transfer switch line and load sides (where accessible):\n     - 30 A: Hot‚ÄìNeutral ‚âà0.0‚Äì1.0 VAC; Hot‚ÄìGround ‚âà0.0‚Äì1.0 VAC; Neutral‚ÄìGround ‚âà0.0‚Äì1.0 VAC (LoZ recommended).\n     - 50 A: L1‚ÄìN ‚âà0; L2‚ÄìN ‚âà0; L1‚ÄìG ‚âà0; L2‚ÄìG ‚âà0; L1‚ÄìL2 ‚âà0; N‚ÄìG ‚âà0.\n   - DC: At DC distribution bus and suspect circuit feed ‚âà0.0 V.\n   - Photo checkpoint: DMM readings at AC panel and DC bus near 0 V.\n8.

Open panels with insulated tools; secure fasteners.\n2. Label circuits: Verify/establish AC breakers (note AFCI/GFCI/dual-function) and DC fuses; use temporary IDs if needed.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Panel before/after labeling.\n3. Inspect wiring/terminations: Discoloration, melted insulation, corrosion, loose strands/lugs, improper splices, abrasion points, pinched or unsupported harnesses.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Damage/corrosion close-ups.\n4. Grounds/bonding:\n   - Clean/tight chassis grounds; remove paint under lugs; use star washers where specified.\n   - Confirm neutral is isolated from ground in RV subpanels. Note: DMM continuity alone can be misleading due to parallel paths/filters. If continuity is suspected, isolate the neutral bar (lift feeder neutral or open ATS/inverter neutral) and re-test, or verify by checking for neutral current on equipment grounding conductors with a clamp when energized (should be ‚âà0 A).\n5. GFCI/AFCI/EMS/SPD survey:\n   - Locate main GFCI(s), AFCI/dual-function breakers, downstream outlets, EMS/surge device; check indicators and mechanical integrity. Replace EMS/SPD devices showing MOV end-of-life/fault. Log model and firmware/indicator status.\n6.

Common open-neutral points (50 A systems in particular):\n   - Inspect shore cord caps (neutral blade discoloration), RV inlet, transfer switch neutral lugs for heat/discoloration/looseness. Plan to torque and thermally scan after re-energizing.\n8. Start a baseline log:\n   - Component names, circuit IDs, AWG/insulation, terminal types, breaker/fuse manufacturer/model/rating, panelboard model. Record the source of each torque specification (panel labeling/OEM manual).\n\nPROCEDURE SECTION C: Baseline Electrical Measurements\n1. Battery open-circuit voltage (OCV):\n   - With batteries isolated and after rest 10‚Äì30 minutes (or remove surface charge by applying a brief 10‚Äì20 A load for ~30 seconds and wait 2 minutes), measure at posts.\n   - Flooded/AGM typical: ~12.6‚Äì12.8 V full; ~12.2 V ‚âà50% SOC.\n   - LiFePO4 typical: Full rested OCV ‚âà13.3‚Äì13.4 V; OCV is flat vs SOC‚Äîuse BMS/SOC monitor when available.\n   - Photo checkpoint: DMM on battery posts.\n2. Specific gravity (flooded only):\n   - Record temperature-compensated SG per cell; normal cell-to-cell difference ‚â§0.015. 0.015‚Äì0.030 indicates imbalance‚Äîconsider equalize per OEM. >0.030 suggests a failing cell.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Hydrometer reading.\n3. Re-energize DC for testing only (pre-charge/inrush control):\n   - Ensure all chargers/PV sources are isolated to prevent backfeed during precharge.\n   - Precharge method: Temporarily connect battery positive through a 5‚Äì10 Œ©, 25‚Äì50 W resistor (with an inline fuse) or a 12 V incandescent lamp to the inverter/DC bus for 5‚Äì30 seconds. Monitor inverter DC input voltage; when it rises near battery voltage, remove the precharge lead, then make the main connection. Expect the resistor to heat; handle accordingly. Reconnect negatives and torque to OEM spec; apply protectant.\n   - Battery reconnect safeguard: Observe initial DC current with a clamp meter upon reconnect to detect abnormal inrush/shorts before fully energizing all systems.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Torque tool set/connection final.\n4. DC bus voltage:\n   - At DC fuse panel main feed, should be within 0.2 V of battery posts with minimal load.\n5. Component feed check:\n   - At suspect component connector/receptacle, measure supply presence, value, and polarity; record.\n6. DC voltage drop under load:\n   - With the load ON, measure:\n     - Positive-side drop: battery positive to component positive.\n     - Return-side drop: battery negative to component negative.\n   - Criteria:\n     - Sensitive/critical DC loads: ‚â§3% Vdrop.\n     - General lighting/outlets (DC): ‚â§5% Vdrop.\n     - Investigate any circuit >10% Vdrop.\n   - Thermal scan under load: Use thermal imager when possible; flag connections >10‚Äì15¬∞C (18‚Äì27¬∞F) hotter than peers and/or >20¬∞F above ambient; absolute action threshold: any termination >30¬∞C (54¬∞F) above ambient or trending upward requires corrective action. If using a spot thermometer, compare like terminations and account for emissivity (prefer matte surfaces/tape).\n   - Photo checkpoint: Any hotspot thermal image.\n7. Converter/charger and inverter-charger check:\n   - Temporarily energize shore power with PPE if panel exposure is required.\n   - Measure at battery:\n     - Float ‚âà13.2 V (typical), Absorption ‚âà14.2‚Äì14.6 V per OEM, Bulk ‚âà14.4‚Äì14.6 V per OEM; apply temperature compensation as applicable. LiFePO4‚Äîfollow OEM charge profiles; do not charge below 0¬∞C unless BMS/heaters support it.\n   - DC ripple measurement: Prefer oscilloscope (AC-coupled) at battery terminals for ripple. If using a DMM, measure AC mV RMS at battery with awareness of meter bandwidth/limitations. Action level: investigate at ‚â•100‚Äì200 mV RMS (confirm OEM limits).\n   - De-energize if further isolation required.\n8. AC outlet/GFCI/AFCI tests:\n   - With shore power safely energized and PPE for panel exposure, use outlet tester to verify polarity and GFCI function; use built-in TEST/RESET on GFCI/AFCI/dual-function devices (external testers may not reliably trip AFCIs).\n   - MWBC/shared-neutral circuits: Require 2-pole common-trip breakers per NEC 210.4(B) and panel listing; handle ties alone may not be sufficient. Verify correct neutral pigtailing in AFCI/GFCI devices.\n   - Outlet tester limitations: 3-light testers can be fooled by bootleg N‚ÄìG bonds or high-impedance grounds. When readings are suspect, verify with DMM measurements and visual inspection.\n   - AC voltage drop: Under representative load, check that branch-circuit voltage drop is acceptable (target ‚â§5% total at the farthest outlet per NEC informational note).\n\nPROCEDURE SECTION D: Symptom-Based Diagnosis\n1. No power to a DC component:\n   - Verify fuse with DMM continuity; do not rely on visual.\n   - Trace voltage path: Battery ‚Üí main DC feed ‚Üí fuse panel input ‚Üí fuse output ‚Üí switch/relay ‚Üí component ‚Üí ground return.\n   - Wiggle test harnesses/connectors for intermittent drops; inspect grounds.\n   - Photo checkpoint: DMM at the point where voltage is lost.\n2. No/limited AC power:\n   - Verify pedestal (retest if moved): 30 A or 50 A readings per Section A, within 114‚Äì126 VAC (each 120 V leg).\n   - Check EMS/surge status codes; verify SPD/EMS health indicators.\n   - Ensure RV main breaker ON; reset all breakers fully (OFF then ON).\n   - Reset primary GFCI; verify downstream outlets.\n   - With power isolated, evaluate suspect breaker: continuity plus voltage drop across closed breaker under load (<100‚Äì200 mV typical for 15‚Äì50 A breakers); or substitute with a listed known-good breaker of the exact type to confirm.\n3. Dim/flickering DC lights:\n   - Measure at battery and at light under load. If battery <12.0 V (Flooded/AGM), charge then retest. For LiFePO4 rely on BMS/SOC, not OCV alone.\n   - If Vdrop exceeds criteria, inspect for undersized wiring, corroded grounds, failing switches/contacts; repair/resize as needed.\n4. Repeated GFCI trips:\n   - Unplug all loads; reset GFCI; plug in devices one at a time to isolate.\n   - If tripping with no loads, check exterior/outlet boxes for moisture/damage; dry/replace; inspect cabling for ground faults or neutral-ground connections on load side.\n5. AFCI/dual-function trips:\n   - Identify circuit devices; check for shared-neutral/MWBC miswiring (ensure 2-pole common-trip and proper neutral pigtail).\n   - Inspect for arcing at connections, damaged cords, or nuisance sources (older motor brushes); correct wiring and replace damaged devices.\n6. Inverter not powering loads / transfer issues:\n   - DC input at inverter lugs ‚â•12.0 V under load (Flooded/AGM) or per LiFePO4 spec; inspect ANL/MEGA fuses and DC lugs for heat; torque per OEM.\n   - Confirm load within inverter rating; reduce/shed loads or reconfigure subpanel.\n   - Verify transfer switch operation (for 50 A, verify both legs), line frequency ‚âà60 Hz, and EMS states.\n   - Neutral switching/bonding per OEM (Section E.7). Mis-bonding can cause GFCI trips and hazards.\n7. Parasitic battery drain:\n   - Allow modules to sleep 15‚Äì45 minutes with all systems off and doors closed.\n   - Preferred: Low-amp DC clamp with 1 mA resolution around a single negative cable; stabilize reading.\n   - Alternate: In-line fused DMM on 10 A/low mA range or precision shunt; avoid opening circuits that reset modules until ready. Typical: 50‚Äì150 mA; >300 mA warrants isolation.\n   - Pull DC fuses one at a time to identify the circuit; note current changes. Some inverters/monitors have standby draw.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Clamp/shunt reading and identified fuse/circuit.\n8. AC polarity/grounding issues:\n   - If outlet tester shows reverse polarity/open ground, correct at receptacle/junction (hot/neutral/ground), verify grounds/bonds, then retest. Verify shore inlet ground pin to RV chassis continuity (<1 Œ© typical).\n9. Insulation resistance testing:\n   - Do not use a megohmmeter on circuits containing or connected to inverters/chargers, control boards, or sensitive electronics unless OEM explicitly approves and all sensitive loads are fully isolated.\n\nPROCEDURE SECTION E: Corrective Actions and Repairs\n1. Connections:\n   - Clean to bright metal; apply anti-oxidant on aluminum; reassemble and torque to manufacturer spec; apply protectant. Record torque values and the source of each torque spec (panel labeling/OEM manual).\n   - Photo checkpoint: Before/after of corrected lug.\n2. Conductors:\n   - Cut back to clean copper; use tinned copper, adhesive heat-shrink terminals; crimp with ratcheting tool (correct die); tug test; heat-shrink. Avoid wire nuts; use crimped/heat-shrink or OEM connectors.\n3. Fuses/breakers/devices:\n   - Replace only with exact type/rating and listed devices specifically approved for the panelboard/enclosure (manufacturer/model/type/interrupt rating). Do not mix manufacturers unless panel labeling lists them as acceptable. Record part numbers.\n4. GFCI/AFCI/dual-function:\n   - Replace with UL-listed, correct rating/type; connect LINE/LOAD correctly. For MWBC, use listed 2-pole common-trip breakers; ensure neutral is correctly pigtailed. Test with built-in button and external tester where appropriate.\n5. Components/relays/switches:\n   - Use OEM-approved parts; ensure mounting, strain relief, clearances; route wiring to avoid abrasion; secure with UV-rated ties.\n6. Labeling/records:\n   - Update circuit labels, panel directory, schematics if available, and service records; add date-coded service label near panel. Record torque values with sources, breaker/fuse manufacturer/model, and device serial numbers/firmware where applicable.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Updated panel labels/service tag.\n7. Neutral switching and bonding checks (document per source):\n   - With RV de-energized, verify subpanel neutral isolated from ground (no continuity; isolate neutral bar if needed to avoid false indications).\n   - Source-specific:\n     - Shore (30 A or 50 A): Neutral‚Äìground bond at service/pedestal only; RV transfer switch should not bond neutral. With shore connected and energized, verify no neutral current on equipment grounding conductors (‚âà0 A) using a clamp, and confirm no unintended N‚ÄìG bond inside RV.\n     - Generator: Many generators bond neutral internally; transfer switch must switch neutral appropriately for bonded generators. Verify generator output N‚ÄìG bond per OEM and transfer switch operation.\n     - Inverter: Many inverter/chargers bond N‚ÄìG only when inverting and open the bond in pass-through. Verify neutral relay function by observing N‚ÄìG status per mode (OEM procedure) and absence of nuisance GFCI trips.\n   - Functionally verify using a receptacle analyzer and by measuring any unintended neutral current on EGCs when energized.\n8. Automation risk controls:\n   - Disable any auto-leveling/auto-retract systems or scheduled loads that could start unexpectedly during service; document status.\n\nPROCEDURE SECTION F: Functional Verification and Post-Service\n1. Re-energize in stages (apply inrush control as needed):\n   - DC only: Pre-charge if applicable (as in C.3); connect battery negative(s) and torque; verify repaired DC functions; monitor initial DC current with clamp meter.\n   - Converter/shore:\n     - For shore: With pedestal verified (Section A.5), plug in with breaker OFF, then turn pedestal breaker ON. For 50 A, verify both legs present: L1‚ÄìN 114‚Äì126 V; L2‚ÄìN 114‚Äì126 V; L1‚ÄìL2 ‚âà240 V; N‚ÄìG ‚âà0 V at main panel; check EMS/SPD status.\n     - Under representative load, confirm each 120 V leg remains ‚â•114 V at the main panel (pedestal under-load verification).\n     - Verify converter/inverter-charger output voltage mode and DC ripple; check AC distribution; listen/smell for issues.\n   - Inverter: Power ON; verify transfer and AC output under representative load; confirm neutral switching behavior is correct.\n   - Generator: Ensure AGS remains disabled; start manually; verify voltage/frequency per leg 114‚Äì126 VAC and ‚âà59.4‚Äì60.6 Hz. For 50 A-capable generators, verify both legs and L1‚ÄìL2 ‚âà240 V; confirm proper neutral/ground bonding per source.\n2. Safety devices:\n   - Test GFCIs; verify AFCI/dual-function where installed; verify CO/LP alarms and any ELCI/EMS indicators.\n3. Thermal inspection:\n   - After 10‚Äì15 minutes under representative load, scan repaired connections/panels with thermal imager (preferred) or comparative spot method; no hotspot >10‚Äì15¬∞C above peer connections, >20¬∞F above ambient, or >30¬∞C (54¬∞F) above ambient absolute; investigate any upward-trending temperature.\n   - Photo checkpoint: Thermal images under load.\n4. Documentation:\n   - Record all readings (V, A, ripple, frequency), parts used, torque values and their sources, corrective actions, panel/breaker/device models, inverter/charger and EMS serial numbers/firmware, pedestal test results (no-load and under-load). Note any OEM service bulletins/recalls checked and outcomes.\n   - Capture final photos of restored work area.\n5. Customer briefing:\n   - Explain fault cause, repairs, and preventive tips (e.g., always test pedestal before connecting and avoid low voltage). Provide warranty info; schedule follow-up if appropriate.\n6. Remove LOTO:\n   - Confirm tools removed, covers installed, area clean; remove group locks via hasp (each worker removes their own lock); remove tags in reverse order; restore system settings.\n   - Post-service AGS: Re-enable AGS and verify settings were preserved/restored; document final AGS state.\n\nMAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE:\n- DC system visual inspection: Monthly‚Äîwear/corrosion/chafing; clean; document.\n- Safety devices: Monthly‚Äîtest GFCIs; quarterly test AFCI/dual-function; test CO/LP detectors; replace GFCIs every 10 years and detectors per OEM age-out.\n- Battery maintenance:\n  - Flooded: Monthly electrolyte and SG; top with distilled water; clean/protect terminals. SG balance normal ‚â§0.015.\n  - AGM/LiFePO4: Quarterly terminal inspection and voltage check; follow OEM procedures; do not use hydrometer or traditional load tester on LiFePO4; do not charge LiFePO4 below 0¬∞C unless BMS/heater supports it.\n- Charging system performance: Annually or pre-season‚Äîverify converter/inverter-charger outputs under load; absorption/equalize modes per OEM; record ripple with method noted.\n- Panel label audit: Annually‚Äîconfirm labels match circuits; update.\n- Inverter filters/vents: Every 6 months or per OEM; clean.\n- Shore power cord/inlet: Inspect before each trip; look for neutral blade discoloration; replace if damaged. Test pedestal (114‚Äì126 VAC) before connecting; verify under-load voltage ‚â•114 V.\n- Professional inspection: Annually‚Äîcomplete system test and records update; verify compliance.\n\nREFERENCED_DOCUMENTS:\n- Winnebago owner/service manuals and electrical schematics (model/year specific)\n- RVIA service guidelines and low-voltage standards\n- NFPA 70 (NEC), Article 551: Recreational Vehicles and RV Parks\n- NFPA 1192: Standard on Recreational Vehicles\n- NFPA 70E: Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace (EEWP, PPE, approach boundaries, AoV testing)\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147: Control of Hazardous Energy (LOTO)\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S: Electrical (including 1910.333 Selection and Use of Work Practices, 1910.335 Safeguards for Personnel Protection)\n- OSHA 1910 Subpart D: Walking-Working Surfaces (falls/ladders)\n- ANSI C84.1: Electric Power Systems and Equipment‚ÄîVoltage Ratings (60 Hz)\n\nDEFINITIONS_TERMS:\n- 30 A 120 V shore (TT-30): Single-pole 120 V service (no L1/L2 split-phase).\n- 50 A 120/240 V split-phase (14-50): Two 120 V legs (L1/L2) 180¬∞ apart; L1‚ÄìL2 ‚âà240 V potential exists even if no 240 V loads are installed.\n- Open neutral (split-phase): Loss of neutral causing over/undervoltage on 120 V loads; can damage equipment.\n- Converter: AC to DC; charges batteries/powers DC loads.\n- Inverter/Inverter-Charger: DC to AC; may charge when AC present; may switch/bond neutral when inverting.\n- EMS/SPD: Electrical Management System and Surge Protective Device monitoring/protecting pedestal faults/sags/surges; MOV end-of-life indicators signal replacement.\n- GFCI/AFCI/Dual-function: Personnel protection devices; dual-function combines both.\n- Transfer Switch (ATS): Switches AC source between shore, generator, inverter; may switch neutral.\n- Parasitic Draw: Current consumed when RV is ‚Äúoff‚Äù (typical 50‚Äì150 mA).\n- Specific Gravity (SG): Flooded battery electrolyte density indicating SOC; balance criteria in Section C.2.\n- LoZ: Low-impedance meter mode to mitigate ghost voltages.\n- LOTO: Lockout/Tagout to de-energize and prevent re-energization; group LOTO when multiple workers.\n- Neutral-Ground Bond: Permitted only at the active source (service/pedestal, generator, or inverter when inverting), not in RV subpanels.\n- Voltage Drop Targets: DC sensitive ‚â§3%, DC general ‚â§5%, DC max 10% (investigate); AC branch circuits target ‚â§5% total at farthest outlet under load.\n\nNOTES AND CAUTIONS:\n- Shore pedestal testing: Always test with a receptacle adapter before connecting.

Removed L1/L2 language from 30 A contexts.\n- Added pedestal acceptance ranges (ANSI C84.1 Range A 114‚Äì126 VAC) and under-load verification; included EMS typical trip points.\n- Upgraded meter safety guidance to CAT III 1000 V or CAT IV 600 V; specified fused probes with finger guards and use of receptacle adapters.\n- Enhanced LOTO: Added lock devices (plug locks, breaker lockouts/hasps, lockable battery/inverter/PV disconnects), group LOTO procedure, tagout with additional measures and justification where lockout infeasible.\n- Added formal emergency response plan (shock/arc-flash, battery acid, fire/evacuation), incident reporting, and post-incident equipment reinspection.\n- Required second qualified person (CPR/AED, rescue-trained) for energized work; identified AED location and EMS access.\n- Added area control for energized work: approach boundaries, barricades/tape, ‚ÄúDANGER ‚Äî ENERGIZED WORK‚Äù signage.\n- Upgraded battery chemical PPE (goggles + face shield, acid apron) and eyewash within 10 seconds.\n- Added HazCom/OSHA 1910.1200 requirements (SDS, secondary container labeling, training).\n- Added fall protection details per OSHA Subpart D, ladder tie-off, wheel chocks, and housekeeping.\n- Expanded generator lockout (starter battery disconnect lock or locked fused link removal; tag remote starts; verify zero energy).\n- Added stored-energy controls: capacitor discharge/wait times and re-test AoV.\n- Added lithium battery thermal event guidance (evacuate, call 911; exposures cooling only if safe).\n- Added portable tools/cords GFCI requirements per OSHA 1910.334; no defeating grounds.\n- Clarified glove standards (ASTM D120), storage separation, decontamination after acid exposure, retest interval, out-of-service criteria.\n- Prohibited working alone for energized/confined tasks; required spotter/attendant and rescue plan.\n- Added requirement to document site address/lot and communications in job briefing.\n- Explicitly referenced OSHA 1910.333/.335 to complement Subpart S citations.\n- Tightened flooded battery SG balance criteria (‚â§0.015 normal; 0.015‚Äì0.030 imbalance; >0.030 failing).\n- Added LiFePO4 specifics: OCV ‚âà13.3‚Äì13.4 V full; flat OCV curve; BMS protections; no charging below 0¬∞C unless supported.\n- Clarified DC ripple measurement method and action levels (prefer oscilloscope; 100‚Äì200 mV RMS DMM action level unless OEM differs).\n- Expanded pre-charge/inrush control with repeatable method and backfeed caution; added reconnect current clamp check.\n- Added AC voltage drop checks under load (‚â§5% target).\n- Highlighted common open-neutral points (cord cap, inlet, ATS neutral lugs) and included torque/thermal scan.\n- Noted outlet tester limitations and DMM/visual verification when suspect.\n- Added breaker evaluation via under-load voltage drop (<100‚Äì200 mV typical) or known-good substitution.\n- Required 2-pole common-trip breakers for MWBC per NEC 210.4(B) and panel listing.\n- Added grounding continuity checks: shore inlet ground to chassis <1 Œ©; DC negative-to-chassis single-point bond only.\n- Specified generator tolerances (114‚Äì126 VAC, ‚âà59.4‚Äì60.6 Hz per leg; verify L1‚ÄìL2 on 120/240 V units).\n- Added EMS/SPD health verification, MOV end-of-life indicators, and logging of model/firmware.\n- Clarified NFPA 70E PPE selection depends on task/equipment/fault current/clearing time; 8 cal/cm¬≤ retained as conservative default when labels absent.\n- Required documentation of torque sources with measured values.\n- Added absolute thermal action threshold (‚â•30¬∞C/54¬∞F above ambient or upward trend).\n- Added pedestal under-load verification step and acceptance criteria.\n- Clarified extinguisher wording to ‚ÄúABC multipurpose or CO2 on energized equipment.‚Äù\n- Added automation risk controls and explicit post-service AGS re-enable/documentation.\n\n---\n\n**üìä ARBITRATION NOTES:**\n‚Ä¢ Scope/safety gap for 50A split-phase RVs: SOP states it excludes 240 VAC systems, but many Winnebago coaches use 50A 120/240 split-phase service. Even without 240V loads, 240V potential exists between L1 and L2 at the transfer switch and main panel. The SOP does not instruct to verify both legs (L1, L2) and L1‚ÄìL2 ~240 VAC, nor warn about open-neutral hazards. This is a significant safety and diagnostic omission.\n‚Ä¢ Absence-of-voltage verification on AC side omits a neutral-to-ground check. It specifies hot-to-neutral and hot-to-ground only; N‚ÄìG should also be verified near 0 V to confirm full de-energization.\n‚Ä¢ Parasitic draw tooling may be impractical: Most common DC clamp meters do not have true mA resolution on DC needed for 50‚Äì300 mA measurements. The tools list could mislead techs; a low-amp DC clamp or a calibrated shunt/in-line method is typically required.\n‚Ä¢ Energized work controls incomplete: While PPE is mentioned, NFPA 70E requirements such as an Energized Electrical Work Permit (EEWP), approach boundaries, arc-rated clothing specifications (cal/cm¬≤), and job briefing are not addressed.\n‚Ä¢ Rubber glove controls incomplete: No requirement to air-test before use, inspect for damage, or ensure Class 0 gloves are within the 6‚Äëmonth dielectric test interval and properly stored.\n‚Ä¢ Shore pedestal testing is not required before connection during intake. Pedestal verification appears only in symptom diagnosis, not as a pre-energization control to prevent damage (e.g., open neutral, miswire).\n‚Ä¢ Converter/charger expected voltage range is too narrow. Many smart converters float at ~13.2 V; SOP lists 13.6‚Äì14.4 V and could lead to false faults when the converter is in float.\n‚Ä¢ DC voltage drop targets are inconsistent: It states <3% for critical circuits and also a fixed <0.5 V for lighting, which at 12 V equals ~4.2%. This may confuse technicians about acceptance criteria.\n‚Ä¢ Breaker replacement guidance incomplete: It should state that replacements must be listed and specifically approved for the panelboard (manufacturer/model), not just NEC Article 551 compliant.\n‚Ä¢ Generator auto-start (AGS) not explicitly disabled: Removing the key may not prevent AGS from starting. SOP should direct disabling AGS in the controller or isolating the remote start circuit.\n‚Ä¢ Battery/inverter reconnection inrush not addressed: Large inverters and chargers present high input capacitance; reconnecting batteries without pre-charge can cause arcing or nuisance fuse blows.\n‚Ä¢ Thermal scan method may be unreliable with only an IR thermometer; scanning panels is best with a thermal imager. If using a spot thermometer, comparative method and emissivity considerations should be stated.\n‚Ä¢ Fire extinguisher classification could be clearer: It specifies Class C but many RVs carry ABC multipurpose. Clarify that an extinguisher rated for Class C (e.g., ABC or CO2) is required.\n‚Ä¢ AFCI protection not mentioned: Newer RVs may include AFCI or dual-function breakers. SOP does not address testing/troubleshooting AFCI trips or shared-neutral/MWBC considerations.\n‚Ä¢ Neutral switching and bonding checks lack detail: Inverters/transfer switches that switch neutral require verification that the neutral-ground bond is only at the active source and that neutral switching operates correctly under all sources.\n‚Ä¢ Battery open-circuit voltage measurements do not specify a rest period after charging/discharging to dissipate surface charge, which can skew readings.\n‚Ä¢ The 'TROUBLESHOOTING_ISSUES' section at the end repeats some information from Section D (Symptom-Based Diagnosis) and could be better integrated to avoid redundancy and improve flow.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Address 50A split-phase explicitly: Add steps to identify split-phase service, measure L1‚ÄìN, L2‚ÄìN (~120 VAC each), and L1‚ÄìL2 (~240 VAC). Include warnings about open neutral hazards (over/undervoltage on 120V loads) and require appropriate PPE when working in areas where both legs are present.\n‚Ä¢ Add pre-energize shore pedestal verification to Section A: Inspect receptacle, test with DMM/plug-in analyzer for correct voltages, polarity, and ground. For 50A: verify L1‚ÄìN and L2‚ÄìN ~120 VAC, L1‚ÄìL2 ~240 VAC, N‚ÄìG ~0 VAC. Do this before plugging the RV in.\n‚Ä¢ Enhance energized work compliance: Require an Energized Electrical Work Permit (EEWP) when justified energized testing is necessary; define approach boundaries; specify minimum arc-rated clothing (e.g., Category 1 or 2, commonly 8 cal/cm¬≤ long-sleeve shirt/pants), arc-rated face shield with balaclava, hearing protection, safety glasses, Class 0 gloves with leather protectors, and insulated mat; mandate a documented job briefing and a second person if policy requires.\n‚Ä¢ Expand rubber glove procedures: Daily field air test and visual inspection; confirm Class 0 gloves are within the 6-month test date; store in glove bags away from ozone/UV; replace damaged gloves immediately.\n‚Ä¢ Parasitic draw measurement: Specify a low-amp DC clamp probe with 1 mA resolution (e.g., 0‚Äì30 A Hall-effect probe) or use a calibrated shunt/in-line fused DMM method. Note clamp placement (single conductor only) and stabilization time for vehicle modules.\n‚Ä¢ Broaden converter/inverter charging expectations: Document and accept typical modes (e.g., float ~13.2 V, absorption ~14.4 V, bulk ~14.4‚Äì14.6 V per OEM). Record charging mode and DC ripple (<~50‚Äì100 mV AC RMS on the DC bus is typical for healthy converters).\n‚Ä¢ Clarify DC voltage drop criteria: Use percent values aligned with best practice (e.g., 3% max for sensitive/critical DC loads, 5% typical for general lighting, 10% absolute maximum). Measure and record both positive- and return-side drops.\n‚Ä¢ Breaker and device replacement: State that replacement breakers/receptacles must be listed and specifically approved for the panelboard/enclosure and match type/interrupt rating. Do not mix manufacturers unless the panel lists them as acceptable.\n‚Ä¢ Explicitly disable Auto Gen Start (AGS): In Section A LOTO, add steps to disable AGS in the controller settings and/or disconnect the remote start leads so the generator cannot start automatically during service.\n‚Ä¢ Add pre-charge/inrush control: When reconnecting batteries to large inverters/chargers or capacitor-heavy DC buses, pre-charge through a resistor/inrush-limiter before installing the main fuse/cable to prevent arcing and fuse damage.\n‚Ä¢ Improve absence-of-voltage test: Include neutral-to-ground check on AC, and verify at both line and load sides of main disconnects/breakers where accessible. Continue to prove the tester before and after per NFPA 70E.\n‚Ä¢ Thermal inspection: Prefer a thermal imager for panel scans. If using an IR thermometer, compare similar terminations under equal load and flag any connection >10‚Äì15¬∞C (18‚Äì27¬∞F) hotter than peers and/or >20¬∞F above ambient, considering emissivity.\n‚Ä¢ Fire extinguisher clarity: Specify a Class C-rated extinguisher (e.g., ABC multipurpose or CO2). Ensure technicians know not to use water on energized equipment.\n‚Ä¢ AFCI/GFCI coverage: Add procedures to identify AFCI or dual-function breakers, test with appropriate testers, and troubleshoot shared neutral/MWBC issues (ensure handle ties and common-trip where required).\n‚Ä¢ Neutral switching/bonding detail: Add checks to verify inverter/transfer switch neutral switching functions correctly and that the neutral-ground bond is present only at the active source (shore service main, generator, or inverter when sourcing). Document test results per source.\n‚Ä¢ Battery OCV measurement: After isolating and before reading OCV, allow batteries to rest 10‚Äì30 minutes (or apply a brief surface charge removal load) for more accurate SOC estimation.\n‚Ä¢ Pedestal/load testing: Where practical, load test the pedestal (or observe voltage sag under RV load via EMS logs) to identify poor campground wiring that could mimic RV faults.\n‚Ä¢ Tooling detail: Note that non-contact voltage testers can be unreliable on inverter outputs; rely on TRMS meters for AC measurements, as already specified.\n‚Ä¢ Labeling and documentation: Record breaker/fuse manufacturer/model, ratings, torque values, and serial numbers/firmware of inverters/chargers and EMS. Check for relevant OEM service bulletins/recalls and document outcomes.\n‚Ä¢ Add insulated barriers: Use insulating blankets or barriers inside open panels to cover adjacent live parts during necessary energized tests; maintain one-hand technique and minimize exposure time.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ üö® MOTHER SAFETY CORRECTIONS: Lockout/Tagout uses tags only in several steps. OSHA 1910.147 requires lockout where feasible. Add lockable devices (plug lock for shore cord, breaker lockouts/hasps, lockable battery disconnects, inverter/charger and PV disconnect locks) and a group LOTO procedure. If true lockout is not possible (e.g., campground pedestal), implement compliant tagout with additional measures and verification, and document the justification., Add a formal emergency response plan. Include steps for electrical shock/arc-flash burns (do not touch victim until power is removed; use insulated rescue hook; call 911; start CPR/AED if trained), battery acid skin/eye exposure (flush eyes/skin with water for at least 15 minutes; remove contaminated clothing; seek medical care), and fire response/evacuation with muster and headcount. Specify incident reporting and post-incident equipment reinspection before re-energizing., NFPA 70E energized work rescue support is not explicit. Require a second qualified person, trained in CPR/AED and shock/arc-flash rescue, to be present for any task within approach boundaries or with exposed energized conductors. Identify AED location and ensure timely EMS access., Area control for energized work is incomplete. Define and enforce approach boundaries for 120/240 V (establish limited approach boundary and restricted ‚Äòavoid contact‚Äô), install barricades/tape, and post Danger‚ÄîEnergized Work signage to keep unqualified persons out., Battery chemical PPE needs upgrade. Require chemical splash goggles plus a face shield and acid-resistant apron when checking SG, watering flooded cells, or working near open batteries. Ensure an eyewash station (or portable eyewash) is available within 10 seconds travel time., Add HazCom/OSHA 1910.1200 requirements: maintain SDS for batteries/electrolyte, cleaners, anti-oxidant compounds; label any secondary containers; provide employee training on chemical hazards., Fall protection is under-specified for roof work. If work is performed on RV roofs or elevated positions without guardrails, require fall protection (harness/anchorage) per OSHA 1910 Subpart D, ladder tie-off, stable footing, and weather/wet-surface precautions. Add wheel chocks and site housekeeping to prevent slips/trips., Generator lockout is insufficient. In addition to removing the key and disabling AGS, require lockout of the generator start circuit or starter battery (lockable battery disconnect or fused link removal with lock), and tag any remote start points. Verify zero energy at generator output., Stored energy controls: Expand to include verification and wait times for discharge of all capacitors in transfer switches, EMS/surge devices, and power supplies per OEM guidance, and re-test for absence of voltage before contact., Lithium battery fire guidance is missing. Add instruction that in case of suspected lithium battery thermal event (smoke/venting/fire), evacuate, call 911, and do not attempt to fight a growing battery fire. If safe and authority-approved, cool surrounding exposures; do not use water on energized equipment., Portable electrical tools/cords: Require GFCI-protected temporary power, inspection of cords for damage, and wet-location practices per OSHA 1910.334. Do not defeat equipment grounding conductors., Specify glove standards and care details: reference ASTM D120 labeling, storage separation of rubber and leather protectors, and antiseptic/decontamination steps after acid exposure. Clarify glove retest interval and out-of-service criteria., Add explicit prohibition on working alone for energized tasks and for entry into confined spaces; require a spotter/attendant and a clear rescue plan., Include requirement to identify the work location address/lot number at job briefing for rapid EMS dispatch, and ensure reliable communication (cell/radio)., Reference OSHA 1910.333/.335 work practices (selection/use of work practices and PPE) explicitly to complement 1910 Subpart S citations.\n‚Ä¢ üß† FATHER LOGIC CORRECTIONS: Clarify service types in PURPOSE/SCOPE: 30 A is 120 V single-pole (NEMA TT-30), not split-phase; only 50 A shore is 120/240 V split-phase (NEMA 14-50)., Pedestal acceptance ranges: add go/no-go limits (e.g., ANSI C84.1 Range A 114‚Äì126 VAC; many EMS trip points ‚âà104‚Äì106 V low and ‚âà132 V high). Do not connect outside acceptable range; document readings., Safety category for meters: recommend CAT III 1000 V or CAT IV 600 V for pedestal/transfer switch measurements; use fused probes with finger guards and, where possible, a receptacle adapter instead of probing inside pedestals., Neutral‚Äìground isolation testing caveat: DMM continuity can be misleading due to parallel paths/filters. If continuity is suspected, isolate the neutral bar (lift feeder neutral or open ATS/inverter neutral) or verify by checking for neutral current on equipment grounding conductors with a clamp when energized (should be ‚âà0 A)., Flooded battery SG balance: tighten criterion to ‚â§0.015 SG difference between cells as normal; 0.015‚Äì0.030 indicates imbalance/equalize check; >0.030 suggests a failing cell., Add LiFePO4 specifics: do not use hydrometer or traditional load tester; note typical full OCV ‚âà13.3‚Äì13.4 V (rested), flat OCV curve vs SOC, BMS protections, and no charging below 0¬∞C unless heater/BMS supports it., DC ripple measurement: specify method and limits. Prefer oscilloscope or DMM with AC-coupled, sufficient bandwidth. If using a DMM, treat readings cautiously; set an action level ‚â§100‚Äì200 mV RMS at the battery for modern converters/inverter-chargers, confirm against OEM specs., Pre-charge/inrush control: describe a repeatable method (precharge lead with 5‚Äì10 Œ©, 25‚Äì50 W resistor and inline fuse, or a 12 V incandescent lamp). Monitor inverter DC input rising near battery voltage, remove precharge, then make main connection. Warn about resistor heating and ensure PV/chargers are isolated to prevent backfeed during precharge., Add AC voltage drop check: under representative load, verify branch-circuit voltage drop is acceptable (target ‚â§5% total per NEC informational note), especially for long runs/high-load appliances., Common open-neutral points: add explicit inspection of shore cord caps (neutral blade discoloration), RV inlet, and transfer switch neutral lugs; torque and thermally scan these locations., Outlet tester limitations: note that simple 3-light testers can be fooled by bootleg N‚ÄìG bonds or high-impedance grounds. Verify with a DMM and visual inspection when readings are suspect., Breaker evaluation: instead of continuity only, recommend measuring voltage drop across a closed breaker under load (<100‚Äì200 mV typical for 15‚Äì50 A breakers) or substitute with a listed known-good breaker to confirm faults., MWBC compliance: explicitly require 2-pole common-trip breakers for multiwire branch circuits sharing a neutral per NEC 210.4(B); handle ties alone may not be sufficient depending on panel listing., Grounding continuity: add a check from shore inlet ground pin to RV chassis (<1 Œ© typical) and validate the DC negative-to-chassis bond exists at the designated single point only (no multiple bonds)., Generator tolerances: specify acceptable voltage (114‚Äì126 VAC per leg) and frequency (‚âà59.4‚Äì60.6 Hz) and verify L1‚ÄìL2 on 120/240 V generators even if no 240 V loads are present., EMS/SPD health: add explicit step to verify surge/EMS indicator status and replace devices showing MOV end-of-life/fault; log model and firmware., NFPA 70E note: clarify that PPE category depends on task, equipment condition, available fault current, and clearing time. 8 cal/cm¬≤ is a conservative default; follow the employer‚Äôs arc-flash risk assessment/labels and EEWP., Documentation of torque sources: record the source of each torque spec (panel labeling/OEM manual) along with measured torque values., Thermal scan criteria: add an absolute action threshold (e.g., any termination >30¬∞C/54¬∞F above ambient or trending upward after load) in addition to relative comparisons., Pedestal under-load verification: with a representative RV load applied, confirm pedestal voltage remains within acceptable range (e.g., ‚â•114 V on each leg) to detect weak park wiring., Fire extinguisher wording: state ‚ÄúUse ABC (A:B:C) multipurpose dry chemical or CO2 extinguishers on energized electrical equipment‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúClass C-rated (ABC or CO2)‚Äù for clarity., Automation risk: add note to disable any auto-leveling/autoretract or scheduled loads that could start unexpectedly during service (in addition to AGS)., Battery reconnect safeguard: after reconnect, observe initial DC current with a clamp meter to catch abnormal inrush/shorts before fully energizing all systems., Post-service AGS: explicitly re-enable AGS and verify settings were preserved/restored; document final AGS state., Minor wording cleanup: in PURPOSE/SCOPE and DEFINITIONS, avoid phrasing that could imply L1/L2 exist on 30 A systems; reserve L1/L2 language for 50 A split-phase only.\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SOP REGENERATED with Mother/Father corrections applied\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:31:04.243Z"},"sha256":"262c585fd851fccd28b1754d58a32fd0f50003b9bb1f4bd266440e5f200d56eb"}

Mark connector orientations with a paint pen.\n- Expected: Clear records and compatibility confirmed.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Motor and controller labels; connector markings.\n\n5) Plan slide support (defer installation)\n- Identify OEM-designated support points under the slide floor and stage OEM-approved slide support stands nearby. Do not install or load stands yet; you will install them just before loosening/disengaging any couplers or removing motors (see E1).\n- Expected: Support plan ready; no stands in contact yet.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_TITLE: Safety Verification, Clearance, and Initial Checks\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_STEPS:\n1) Visual inspection\n- Inspect for broken/chafed wires, loose connectors, corrosion/water tracks, missing fasteners, debris in tracks/gears, bent rails, and signs of seal failure.\n- Correct minor debris; document findings.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Any damage/corrosion.\n\n2) Clearance and environment check\n- Verify interior and exterior paths are clear: remove cargo, ensure cabinet/wardrobe doors are latched, slide toppers/awnings retracted or secured, pets/personnel clear of travel path, and no obstructions outside.\n- Expected: Unobstructed, safe movement path.\n\n3) Brief functional check (only if safe and necessary)\n- Temporarily restore power for this step only: reconnect battery negative; leave all charging sources/engine OFF to avoid skewing voltage/current measurements.\n- With a spotter maintaining line-of-sight and one hand at the control for immediate stop/reverse, command slide OUT then IN for 1‚Äì2 seconds to capture the symptom (no movement, clicking, one side moves). Do not allow full travel if binding is suspected. Power down again immediately after.\n- Capture controller LED codes or blink patterns before any resets; some codes clear on power loss.\n- Expected: Symptom reproduced and noted.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Short video of symptom and any controller LEDs.\n\n4) Voltage and current check (initial, controller-side first)\n- With charging sources and engine OFF, measure:\n  - Battery at rest at battery posts (‚â•12.6 V preferred; confirm battery chemistry/SOC and ensure lithium BMS, if present, is not in protect/low-temp state).\n  - Voltage at slide controller input during command (use DMM min/max to capture sag).\n  - Current draw with a clamp meter at the controller output or main slide feed (clamp a single conductor only).\n- Note on access: If motor connector access requires trim removal, defer motor-lead measurements until after Section C. After accessing the motor (Section C), repeat measurements at the motor leads during command to localize drops.\n- If voltage sags below ~11.5 V at the controller during travel, suspect supply/ground/battery issues. A dip toward ~10.5 V indicates severe deficiency requiring correction before further testing.\n- Check the slide circuit protection: identify fuse vs resettable/auto-reset breaker or thermal breaker. Verify correct rating; reset thermal breakers as needed; investigate root cause before replacing.\n- Record whether alternator/chargers are OFF or ON during measurements.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: DMM under-load reading at controller; clamp meter display mid-command.\n\n5) Power down again for service\n- Switch battery disconnect OFF; remove negative cable(s) for house and, if applicable, chassis; verify zero volts at controller and motor. Insulate and secure any positive leads.\n- Perform LOTO ‚Äútry‚Äù step on the slide control; return control to OFF/neutral.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: DMM 0.00 V at motor/controller leads.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_TITLE: Accessing the Motor (By System Type)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_STEPS:\n1) In-wall (Schwintek-style) access\n- Remove interior valance/trim or exterior corner cap per OEM to expose the upper motor pocket/5-pin connector. Carefully pull back seal as needed. Use trim tools to prevent damage.\n- Expected: Clear access to motor flange and connector.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Exposed in-wall motor and connector.\n\n2) Through-frame access\n- From undercoach, locate motor/gearbox on the slide mechanism cross-shaft. Support any belly pan/skid plate before removing final fasteners; wear cut-resistant gloves around sharp edges.\n- Expected: Motor/gearbox fully visible; power/ground leads accessible.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Motor/gearbox and bracket orientation.\n\n3) Harness isolation\n- Disconnect motor connector(s). For in-wall, depress 5-pin locking tab; for through-frame, remove ring terminals from studs (note polarity). Avoid cutting wires; only cut if no serviceable connector exists, leaving ample pigtail. Cap/label wires. Insulate any disconnected positive leads and secure away from chassis metal and moving parts.\n- Expected: Motor electrically isolated; wires labeled and protected.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Disconnected harness with labels and polarity notes.\n\n4) Post-access electrical checks at the motor (if not done earlier)\n- With power briefly restored and a spotter in place, repeat voltage and current measurements at the motor connector during a 1‚Äì2 second command to localize voltage drops and evaluate current.\n- For in-wall systems: measure each motor‚Äôs current separately if possible. Typical per-motor moving current ~3‚Äì8 A; brief peaks up to ~12‚Äì15 A near stops. Total for two motors may be ~8‚Äì18 A with peaks ~25‚Äì30 A.\n- Document left vs right motor current; a side-to-side delta >2‚Äì3 A suggests binding or a failing motor/coupler.\n- Power down and LOTO again.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: DMM/clamp readings at motor connector(s).\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_TITLE: Detailed Diagnosis (Electrical and Mechanical)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_STEPS:\n1) Continuity, supply integrity, and ground drop\n- Check continuity from motor connector back to controller/switch and to chassis ground. Wiggle harness to catch intermittents.\n- Measure voltage at controller input and at motor connector during command to identify drops along the path.\n- Perform dedicated ground drop tests during movement:\n  - Measure between controller ground and a known good chassis ground; target <0.2 V (‚â§0.3 V max).\n  - Measure between motor ground and chassis ground; target <0.2 V (‚â§0.3 V max).\n- Grounding best practices for corrections: clean contact points to bright metal; use serrated/star washers on ground lugs; tighten to spec; protect finished connection with dielectric grease and a boot.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Meter lead placement and readings at controller and motor.\n\n2) Motor bench test (with OEM guidance only)\n- Through-frame motors: May be bench-tested by applying fused 12V directly to the two motor leads; secure the motor/gearbox against torque reaction; limit each direction to 1‚Äì2 seconds.\n- In-wall 5-pin motors: Bench test only with the OEM pinout and test harness. Apply 12V only to the designated motor pair pins through a fused lead. Do not energize Hall sensor or logic pins. If pinout/harness is unknown, test via the controller in the coach or substitute with a known-good motor rather than risking damage.\n- Expected: Strong, smooth operation both directions; abnormal noise/high current indicates internal fault.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Bench test setup and ammeter display (if performed).\n\n3) Mechanical free movement and safety reminder\n- Before loosening any couplers or disengaging brakes, install slide support stands per plan (see E1). Keep personnel clear of potential movement.\n- With motor removed/decoupled (or clutch/brake disengaged if OEM provides a lever/override), verify slide/cross-shaft moves smoothly by hand per OEM procedure.\n  - In-wall: Never force rails manually. Inspect for bent rails, loose set screws, debris. Use OEM override only if explicitly provided; otherwise diagnose/correct bind first.\n  - Through-frame: Rotate cross-shaft with a wrench; expect steady resistance. Support/locate the cross-shaft to prevent lateral shift. Mark shaft position; align set screws with flats/dimples.\n- Hard spots or immovable travel indicate mechanical bind/alignment issues.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Manual rotation point and any slide movement marks.\n\n4) Controller/synchronization assessment (in-wall)\n- Inspect controller LEDs for fault codes (overcurrent, out-of-sync, etc.) and record per OEM chart before cycling power or performing resets (codes may clear on power loss).\n- Note any required controller reset or calibration procedures applicable after motor replacement.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Controller and LED status.\n\nNote: Do not open sealed motor gearboxes. Internal disassembly/greasing is not covered unless explicitly directed by OEM.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_TITLE: Motor Removal and Replacement\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_STEPS:\n1) Prepare and support for removal\n- Confirm zero-energy state (LOTO applied and verified). Protect finishes with pads/cloths. Verify clearance again inside/outside.\n- Install OEM-approved slide support stands at the identified support points under the slide floor. Bring to light, snug contact only‚Äîdo not lift. Use load-spreading pads as needed.\n- Keep operator/spotter emergency stop/reverse plan active during any test jogs.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Supports and protection in place.\n\n2) Remove in-wall motor\n- Remove retaining screws (typically 2‚Äì4 Torx). Support motor while loosening to prevent dropping into wall cavity. Withdraw straight to avoid coupler damage. Note: aluminum rail threads are easily stripped‚Äîobserve OEM torque on reassembly; do not over-torque.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Motor withdrawal showing coupler alignment.\n\n3) Remove through-frame motor\n- Mark coupler orientation and shaft position with a paint pen. Support/locate the cross-shaft to prevent lateral movement when the motor/coupler is removed.\n- Loosen/remove set screws/bolts on the coupler; align set screws with shaft flats/dimples on reassembly. Remove motor bracket bolts while supporting motor/gearbox weight (two hands). Slide off shaft. Retain/use jam nuts if provided per OEM.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Marked coupler and shaft after removal.\n\n4) Inspect components\n- Inspect couplers, splines, set screws, bracket holes, and wiring for wear/elongation. Replace any worn parts before reassembly.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Macro photo of spline/coupler condition.\n\n5) Install replacement motor‚ÄîIn-wall\n- Verify 5-pin keying/clocking. Lightly grease connector seal with dielectric grease. Align motor drive with coupler; seat fully without force. Apply medium thread locker to screws; torque to OEM spec. Example only: small Torx into aluminum often 25‚Äì35 in-lb‚Äîverify with OEM to prevent thread damage.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Motor seated; screws torqued; connector locked, orientation marks aligned.\n\n6) Install replacement motor‚ÄîThrough-frame\n- Align gearbox output with coupler/shaft; seat fully. Apply thread locker to set screws/bolts; torque per OEM. Example only (verify OEM): 1/4-20 cup-point set screws often 70‚Äì90 in-lb; 5/16-18 cup-point often 120‚Äì180 in-lb depending on materials; bracket bolts (e.g., M8/5/16) often 18‚Äì25 ft-lb.\n- Reconnect power/ground with clean ring terminals; use star/serrated washers on grounds; torque per OEM; protect with dielectric grease and boots; ensure correct polarity.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Coupler/set screw positions; torqued bracket hardware; terminal polarity photo.\n\n7) Harness routing and protection\n- Route away from moving parts/sharp edges; add split loom; secure every 8‚Äì10 in with UV-rated ties; create drip loops where water exposure is possible.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Final harness routing and tie placements.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_TITLE: Synchronization, Calibration, Functional Test, and Power Re-Enable\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_STEPS:\n1) Restore power (battery only) and initial jog test (supports remain in place)\n- Reconnect battery negative(s); remove LOTO at battery only. Keep shore/gen/inverter/solar disabled and engine OFF for baseline testing.\n- Verify connector orientation/polarity: confirm 5-pin keying and through-frame motor lead polarity. With spotter ready to stop/reverse, jog IN for 1‚Äì2 seconds then OUT for 1‚Äì2 seconds to verify engagement and direction. If direction is reversed on through-frame, power down and swap the two motor leads.\n- Expected: Correct direction and engagement. Stop immediately if abnormal sounds or binding occur.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Video of first movement with hand at switch.\n\n2) Controller-specific procedures\n- Perform OEM-required sync/reset/calibration procedures for the specific controller (e.g., LCI In-Wall button/LED sequences) after motor replacement or fault correction. Follow OEM time limits precisely. Hold the switch for the OEM-specified time (commonly 3‚Äì5 seconds) where required‚Äîdo not rely on generic values.\n- Document controller status before and after procedures.\n\n3) Synchronize in-wall systems\n- Run fully OUT and hold the switch for the OEM-specified time (commonly 3‚Äì5 seconds) after stop; then fully IN and hold for the specified time. Repeat 2‚Äì3 full cycles to re-sync. Avoid repeated long stalls; allow brief cool-down between cycles if motors become warm.\n- Measure per-motor current during travel when possible; investigate >2‚Äì3 A delta between sides.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Photo showing parallel top/bottom gaps after sync.\n\n4) Verify through-frame alignment\n- Run fully OUT and IN. Check squareness and measure fore/aft edge distances to body. If skew exceeds ~1/8 in, adjust per OEM alignment procedure (structural adjustments out of scope‚Äîescalate if required). Minimize stall time at end-of-travel (‚â§ OEM guidance).\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Measurements at both corners with tape visible.\n\n5) Electrical performance and measurement best practices\n- With charging sources and engine OFF (baseline), measure voltage at controller input and at the motor during travel and current draw with a clamp meter (single conductor only; use inrush/peak capture).\n  - In-wall small slide: per motor ~3‚Äì8 A moving; brief peaks 12‚Äì15 A near stops. Total two-motor ~8‚Äì18 A moving; brief peaks 25‚Äì30 A.\n  - Through-frame large slide: ~15‚Äì30 A moving; brief peaks 35‚Äì45 A near stops.\n- Expected: No significant voltage sag below 11.5 V at the motor during travel. If alternator-assisted testing (engine ON) is required, repeat measurements and document both sets, noting the condition.\n- Perform and document ground-drop measurements at controller and motor grounds during movement; target <0.2 V.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Clamp meter reading mid-travel; DMM min/max capture screenshot/photo.\n\n6) Final fastener re-torque\n- After two full cycles, recheck motor mount and coupler set screw torque. Add witness marks with paint pen.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Witness marks on fasteners.\n\n7) Remove supports\n- Once smooth operation and secure mounting are confirmed, remove slide supports/transit bars. Keep personnel clear of travel path during any further testing.\n\n8) Post-repair power re-enable (controlled sequence)\n- Re-enable power sources in this order, verifying no unexpected loads/faults at each step:\n  1) Close PV disconnect/replace PV fuse or carefully remove panel covers.\n  2) Enable converter/inverter/charger per OEM sequence.\n  3) Reconnect shore power (if used) and remove LOTO.\n  4) Restore generator key control and auto-start (if used).\n  5) Restore any disabled auto-level/auto-slide features only after confirming proper slide operation.\n- Document system status and confirm no fault lights or nuisance trips.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_TITLE: Cleaning, Lubrication, Sealing, Leak Check, and Reassembly\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_STEPS:\n1) Clean/lube appropriately\n- In-wall: Wipe rails clean‚Äîdo not lubricate rails. Treat bulb seals with OEM-approved dry silicone only; avoid petroleum-based products on EPDM/TPE.\n- Through-frame: Lightly apply white lithium to exposed rack-and-pinion/rollers; avoid overspray on seals/flooring.\n- Solvent safety: Use isopropyl/contact cleaner only in ventilated areas away from ignition sources/heat guns; allow vapors to dissipate fully before re-energizing.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Cleaned rails and seal treatment photo.\n\n2) Protect and seal\n- Reinstall trim/valances/belly pans. Replace damaged butyl; re-seal exterior penetrations/caps with appropriate RV sealant. Verify wiper seal orientation and that corner moldings are properly seated. Add drip loops to harnesses where exposed.\n- Record sealant type and lot if required by warranty.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Reinstalled panels and new sealant beads.\n\n3) Post-reseal leak check\n- Perform a low-pressure water test (gentle hose spray or leak detector per shop policy) over disturbed exterior seams/caps. Inspect interior for leaks.\n- Correct any leaks and re-test.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Water test in progress and interior inspection photo.\n\n4) Final inspection and housekeeping\n- Verify tools removed; harness protected from chafe; trims intact; switches labeled; work area clean; cords and panels stored; clear egress pathways and access to emergency equipment.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Wide interior and exterior completion shots.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_TITLE: Documentation, Warranty Handling, and Handover\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_STEPS:\n1) Recordkeeping and privacy\n- Document VIN, slide type, controller model and rev level, old/new motor PNs/serials, torque values, voltage/current readings (including min/max and inrush if captured), ground drop results at controller and motor, alignment measurements, and any controller fault codes before/after resets.\n- Record whether measurements were with or without alternator/chargers enabled (document both sets if performed).\n- Tag and retain replaced motors/parts with serial numbers for warranty return as required; photograph tags.\n- Record sealant brand/type and lot number if required by warranty.\n- Photo privacy: Avoid capturing customer PII (license plates, paperwork, faces). Blur/redact if unavoidable.\nPHOTO CHECKPOINT: Work order screenshot/printout with attached photos.\n\n2) Customer/operator briefing\n- Explain symptoms found, root cause, corrective actions/parts replaced, any limitations, and maintenance tips (battery health/chemistry considerations, operation technique, cleaning/lube schedule, importance of keeping slide toppers in good condition). Review waterproofing work and leak test outcome. Obtain sign-off.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING_ISSUES:\n- No response from slide switch\n  Cause: Blown fuse/resettable breaker tripped, open circuit, bad ground, faulty switch/controller, battery disconnect OFF, LOTO still applied, BCC feed open.\n  Action: Verify battery/disconnect; remove LOTO appropriately; check/reset breaker; replace fuse after finding root cause; test power/ground at controller/motor; repair/replace switch/controller as needed; confirm correct battery (house vs chassis) feed via BCC.\n\n- Clicks but no movement\n  Cause: Low voltage under load, seized motor/gearbox, stuck relay, mechanical bind.\n  Action: Load test battery; confirm lithium BMS not limiting; clean/tighten grounds; check voltage at controller and motor during command; bench test motor (per OEM guidance); inspect rails/gears for debris/bends; repair/replace.\n\n- One side moves and slide racks (in-wall)\n  Cause: Out-of-sync motors, failed motor on one side, stripped coupler/set screw.\n  Action: Capture controller codes; perform OEM sync/reset; test through controller; bench test with OEM harness; compare per-motor current (delta >2‚Äì3 A indicates issue); replace faulty motor/coupler; ensure controller recognizes both motors.\n\n- Motor runs; slide doesn‚Äôt move (through-frame)\n  Cause: Loose coupler set screw, sheared pin, stripped spline, cross-shaft shifted.\n  Action: Support/locate cross-shaft; re-torque with thread locker; align set screws with flats/dimples; replace shear pin/coupler; inspect shaft.\n\n- High current draw, slow movement\n  Cause: Binding tracks/misalignment, dried/insufficient lube (through-frame), weak battery, poor ground with voltage drop.\n  Action: Correct alignment; clean/lube allowed components; charge/replace battery; correct supply/ground issues identified by voltage/ground drop tests.\n\n- Operates in wrong direction after replacement\n  Cause: Reversed polarity at motor leads or mis-keyed connector.\n  Action: De-energize; verify 5-pin keying; swap polarity on through-frame motor leads; retest.\n\n- Intermittent operation\n  Cause: Loose/corroded connections, damaged harness, controller intermittent, thermal trip on motor or controller, auto-reset breaker cycling.\n  Action: Clean/re-terminate with heat-shrink splices or OEM connectors; add loom/ties; restore proper grounds; verify controller connections; allow cool-down; check for obstructed ventilation; verify breaker type/rating.\n\n- Water in motor cavity/corrosion\n  Cause: Failed seals/missing caps, wicking along harness.\n  Action: Dry and replace compromised motor; reseal penetrations; add drip loops; replace grommets/seals; verify by leak check.\n\n- Measurements seem ‚Äútoo good‚Äù\n  Cause: Alternator/charger active masking voltage sag.\n  Action: Repeat tests with engine/chargers OFF; document both conditions if alternator-assisted testing is performed by design.\n\nMAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE:\n- Electrical connections (motor, grounds, controller): Inspect/clean/torque every 12 months or 200 cycles and after water exposure. Include inspection of main ground lugs and any resettable/auto-reset breakers for heat/discoloration.\n- In-wall rails: Wipe clean every 3 months or as needed; never lubricate rails. Lubricate bulb seals with OEM-approved dry silicone every 6 months.\n- Through-frame gears/rollers: Clean and lightly lubricate every 6 months or ~300 cycles.\n- Harness protection: Inspect loom/ties for chafe/UV damage annually; renew drip loops and seals as needed.\n- Functional test: Full extend/retract monthly; observe for equal movement and abnormal noises. Compare per-motor currents on in-wall systems if equipment allows.\n- Battery/charging: Test SOC and under-load voltage every 6 months; maintain clean, tight terminals; verify converter/charger output and ground integrity. For lithium systems, verify BMS settings/limits and low-temperature charge/discharge protections.\n- Slide topper (if equipped): Inspect hardware/tension and fabric each 6‚Äì12 months; binding toppers can increase load and skew alignment.\n\nREFERENCED_DOCUMENTS:\n- Forest River owner/service literature for specific model and VIN.\n- Lippert (LCI) service manuals: In-Wall (Schwintek-style) and Through-Frame slide systems; LCI service bulletins and rev/compatibility matrices.\n- BAL/Norco (Schwintek) installation/service guides.\n- Power Gear/Venture slide-out service guides.\n- RVIA service and repair best practices.\n- OSHA 1910.147 Control of Hazardous Energy (LOTO).\n- OSHA 1910 Subpart I (Personal Protective Equipment).\n- OSHA 1910.1200 Hazard Communication (SDS/labeling).\n- OSHA 1910 Subpart S (Electrical) general electrical safety for tools/outlets.\n- NFPA 70 (NEC) general guidance for low-voltage DC conductors in RVs.\n- SDS for lubricants, dielectric grease, thread locker, cleaners, and batteries used.\n- Battery OEM manuals/SDS for lead-acid and lithium chemistries.\n\nDEFINITIONS_TERMS:\n- In-wall (Schwintek-style): Slide system with vertical aluminum rails and small motors at the slide box, typically one per side.\n- Through-frame: Slide mechanism below floor with a single central motor/gearbox driving both sides via a cross-shaft and rack-and-pinion/rollers.\n- Controller: Electronic module managing motor operation and synchronization.\n- LOTO: Lockout/Tagout to ensure de-energized state during service (includes isolating all charging sources and solar PV).\n- Synchronization (sync): Running to end-of-travel and holding per OEM to align motor timing.\n- Coupler: Mechanical link between motor/gearbox and drive shaft/rail.\n- Witness mark: Paint line across a fastener and adjacent surface to reveal loosening.\n- Ground drop test: Measuring voltage between a device‚Äôs ground and chassis ground during load to detect high-resistance grounds.\n- Backfeed: Unintended voltage present due to alternate power/charging sources despite primary disconnect.\n- BCC: Battery Control Center (may route house/chassis feeds and slide circuits).\n- Auto/resettable breaker: Circuit protection device that resets automatically or manually after thermal trip.\n\nCRITICAL NOTES:\n- Emergency readiness: Identify and communicate site address/bay, emergency equipment locations, and STOP WORK authority before starting.\n- Verify exact motor and controller part numbers and revision/firmware compatibility by VIN and labels before ordering/installation; example numbers are not authoritative.\n- Manufacturer torque specifications, if available, supersede generic values herein. Use caution with aluminum rail threads on in-wall systems.\n- Never lubricate in-wall (Schwintek) rails; lubrication attracts debris and causes binding. Clean rails; treat seals only with OEM-approved products.\n- Support the slide whenever disengaging/removing drive components to prevent unintended movement. Use only OEM-approved slide support stands with wide pads; do not lift the room.\n- Do not use wire nuts on RV slide wiring. Use OEM connectors or marine-grade heat-shrink splices.\n- Do not open sealed motor gearboxes unless explicitly directed by the OEM.\n- Clamp meter use: Clamp a single conductor only; clamping both positive and negative together yields near-zero reading.\n- Limit end-of-travel stall time to OEM guidance. Allow cool-down between repeated cycles to prevent motor overheating.\n- Keep engine and all chargers OFF during baseline diagnostics; document separately if alternator-assisted testing is performed.\n- After any exterior reseal, perform a water leak check prior to customer return.\n- Lithium battery/BMS considerations: BMS current limiting or low-temperature protection can mimic low-voltage sag. Ensure adequate SOC and appropriate temperature range during diagnostics.\n- Solar isolation: Prefer PV disconnect/breaker or controller fuse removal. If covering panels, use purpose-made opaque covers; avoid abrasion; watch for heat buildup and wind.\n- Photo/documentation: Avoid capturing customer PII; redact/blur if unavoidable.\n\n---\n\n**üìä ARBITRATION NOTES:**\n‚Ä¢ LOTO/backfeed gap: SOP does not require disconnecting all charging sources (shore power/converter, generator, inverter/charger, solar PV) or covering PV panels to prevent backfeed during service.\n‚Ä¢ Voltage criteria inconsistency: Section B3 says maintain ‚â•11.5 V under load while Section F4 allows sag down to <10.5 V; these thresholds conflict.\n‚Ä¢ Risky bench test guidance for 5‚Äëpin in‚Äëwall motors: Applying 12 V without an explicit pinout/OEM harness can energize Hall sensor pins and damage electronics.\n‚Ä¢ Ambiguous use of floor jack/jack stands for slide support could damage the slide floor; only OEM‚Äëapproved slide support stands with broad pads should be used and never to lift.\n‚Ä¢ No explicit clearance check before energizing the slide (interior cargo, pets, exterior obstacles, slide toppers/awnings).\n‚Ä¢ Engine/alternator not addressed: Alternator charging can defeat LOTO and skew voltage/current diagnostics if the engine is running.\n‚Ä¢ Controller-specific procedures not covered: Some in‚Äëwall systems require OEM button sequences or controller resets after motor replacement.\n‚Ä¢ Compatibility not verified: No check for motor/controller revision and firmware compatibility (e.g., Schwintek/Lippert rev levels).\n‚Ä¢ Clamp meter usage detail missing: It does not state to clamp a single conductor only; clamping both conductors yields near-zero reading.\n‚Ä¢ Disconnected positive leads not explicitly required to be insulated/secured away from chassis ground (only 'cap/label' is stated).\n‚Ä¢ End-of-travel hold time could overheat motors on through-frame systems; no explicit caution on minimizing stall duration or allowing cool-down.\n‚Ä¢ No post-reseal leak check is specified after disturbing exterior caps/penetrations.\n‚Ä¢ Support placement nuance: Potential to over-constrain or damage slide if stands are not placed at OEM-approved points with load-spreading pads.\n‚Ä¢ Mechanical free-movement step does not reiterate the need for supports before loosening couplers/disengaging brakes, risking unintended movement.\n‚Ä¢ Minor privacy/compliance omission: Photo checkpoints lack a reminder to avoid capturing customer PII in documentation.\n‚Ä¢ The 'DATE_CREATED' field is set to a future date (2025-08-31), which is invalid metadata. It should reflect the actual creation date.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Expand LOTO: Before removing battery negative, disconnect shore power, disable generator and inverter/charger, turn off the converter, and isolate/cover solar PV (or disconnect PV input at the controller). Verify zero volts at the controller and motor with no backfeed.\n‚Ä¢ Unify electrical criteria: Recommend battery at rest ‚â•12.6 V and loaded voltage at the motor ‚â•11.5 V during travel; flag anything below 11.5 V as a supply/ground/battery issue. Use DMM min/max capture to record transient sag.\n‚Ä¢ In-wall motor bench testing: Require OEM test harness/pinout and apply 12 V only to the motor pair pins through a fused lead. If pinout is unknown, test via the controller or replace with known-good motor rather than risk powering sensor pins.\n‚Ä¢ Slide support: Remove 'floor jack and jack stands' as slide supports. Specify OEM-approved slide support stands with wide pads, positioned at OEM-identified support points. Stands should be snug to contact only‚Äîdo not lift the room.\n‚Ä¢ Add a clearance check before any jog: Verify the interior/exterior path is clear, cabinet doors are latched, pets/personnel are clear, and slide toppers/awnings are stowed or secured.\n‚Ä¢ State that the engine/ignition remains OFF during diagnostics to avoid alternator influence, unless a specific test calls for alternator-assisted operation (document both conditions if performed).\n‚Ä¢ Controller procedures: Reference and, when applicable, include OEM-specific sync/reset procedures (e.g., LCI controller button/LED sequences) required after motor replacement or faults.\n‚Ä¢ Compatibility check: Verify motor and controller part numbers and revision levels are compatible per supplier bulletins (Schwintek/Lippert/BAL) before installation.\n‚Ä¢ Clamp meter technique: Instruct to clamp a single conductor (positive or negative) only, route for best separation, and use inrush/peak capture if available.\n‚Ä¢ Explicitly require insulating caps or taped boots on any disconnected positive leads and secure them away from chassis/metal edges to prevent shorts.\n‚Ä¢ Limit stall time: For synchronization, hold the switch only as long as OEM specifies (e.g., 2‚Äì3 s), avoid repeated stalls, and allow cool-down between cycles to prevent motor overheating.\n‚Ä¢ After resealing exterior components, perform a low-pressure water test or leak inspection to verify seal integrity before customer return.\n‚Ä¢ Support placement detail: Use load-spreading pads, avoid unsupported cantilevered areas, and follow OEM diagrams for approved support points to prevent floor/structure damage.\n‚Ä¢ Reiterate in Section D3: Confirm slide supports are in place before loosening couplers/disengaging brakes, and keep personnel clear of potential movement.\n‚Ä¢ Add a supply integrity check: Measure and document voltage at the controller input and perform a ground drop test (voltage between controller ground and chassis) during travel to locate high-resistance connections.\n‚Ä¢ Disable any auto-slide or auto-level features that could command motion during service.\n‚Ä¢ Warranty handling: Tag and retain replaced motors/parts with serial numbers for warranty return; document with photos on the work order.\n‚Ä¢ Measurement best practices: Use DMM min/max for voltage sag and clamp meter peak/inrush features to capture start-up currents accurately.\n‚Ä¢ PPE addition: Recommend cut-resistant gloves around sharp belly pans and a dust mask/respirator if working in dusty/insulated cavities.\n‚Ä¢ Seal care: Specify OEM-approved seal treatments; avoid petroleum-based products on EPDM/TPE seals‚Äîuse dry silicone or OEM-recommended conditioners only.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ üö® MOTHER SAFETY CORRECTIONS: Emergency response procedures are not defined. Add a concise plan covering: stop-work authority, how to summon help (call 911), site address/location to relay to dispatch, roles for spotter to hit stop/reverse, first-aid/bleeding control, crush/pinch injury response, electric burn response, and evacuation. Include locations of first-aid kit, AED (if available), fire extinguishers, and emergency eyewash., Battery/chemical exposure response is missing. Add instructions for wet-cell battery acid exposure (flush eyes/skin with water for 15+ minutes; use eyewash; remove contaminated clothing; seek medical attention), neutralization of small acid spills (baking soda), and proper disposal of contaminated rags per SDS., PPE requirements need to be more explicit. Mandate at minimum: safety glasses with side shields at all times; closed-toe safety footwear; cut-resistant gloves when handling sharp belly pans/metal; tight-fitting gloves or no gloves near rotating shafts to avoid entanglement; face shield or chemical splash goggles when working at battery terminals. Keep hearing protection criteria (>85 dBA) and respirator selection (e.g., N95 for nuisance dust) explicit., LOTO verification lacks a 'try' step. After de-energizing and meter checks, attempt to operate the slide control to verify zero-energy per OSHA 1910.147 before beginning work, then return controls to OFF/neutral., Corded tool electrical safety not addressed. If using corded heat guns/drills, require GFCI-protected outlets, inspect cords for damage before use, and keep cords clear of pooled water per OSHA electrical standards., Solvent/cleaner hazards need explicit warnings. State that isopropyl alcohol and contact cleaners are flammable; use only in well-ventilated areas away from ignition sources/heat guns; allow vapors to dissipate fully before re-energizing circuits; consult SDS., Ladder/step-stool safety could be strengthened. Require inspection before use, Type I or higher rating, set up on firm level surfaces, maintain three points of contact, and prohibit top-step standing per OSHA walking-working surfaces guidance., Crush/entrapment rescue guidance is missing. Define an emergency reversal/stop plan during testing, ensure the operator and spotter maintain line-of-sight, and keep controls immediately accessible to reverse direction if entrapment occurs., Clarify glove use around rotating components. Add caution to avoid loose or bulky gloves near spinning shafts/couplers/gears to prevent entanglement; use snug-fitting gloves only when necessary., Add housekeeping/slip-trip controls. Keep work area and travel paths clear of tools, cords, and removed panels; manage creeper placement; clean spills immediately., OSHA alignment could be improved by explicitly referencing: 1910 Subpart I (PPE) and 1910.1200 (HazCom) in addition to 1910.147 (LOTO), and applying those elements (SDS access/labels, PPE selection) in the SOP., Consider lithium battery nuances. If the coach uses LiFePO4 or other lithium chemistries, note that an ABC extinguisher is limited; follow battery OEM emergency guidance and SDS for thermal events.\n‚Ä¢ üß† FATHER LOGIC CORRECTIONS: Re-sequence for logic/efficiency: Move Section C (Accessing the Motor) before taking motor-lead measurements. In B4, either measure only at the controller first or add a note that motor-lead measurements occur after Section C provides access., Defer setting slide support stands until just before loosening/disengaging any couplers or removing motors (D3/E1). Keeping A5 conditional but early can add unnecessary setup time if no mechanical work is performed., Clarify current numbers for in-wall systems as per-motor vs total. Example: per motor typically ~3‚Äì8 A moving with brief peaks up to ~12‚Äì15 A; total for two motors may be ~8‚Äì18 A with peaks ~25‚Äì30 A. State explicitly which you‚Äôre recording., Correct the example torque for coupler set screws. 70‚Äì90 in-lb is typical for 1/4-20 set screws, not 5/16-18. For 5/16-18 cup-point set screws, typical values are roughly 120‚Äì180 in-lb depending on coupler/shaft material. Prefer OEM torque charts and remove generic numbers if uncertain., Add note that some slide circuits use auto/resettable breakers (and thermal breakers) rather than fuses. Include checking/resetting those devices and verifying correct breaker ratings., Expand LOTO/energy isolation for motorized coaches: verify whether the slide is fed from house or chassis battery via the BCC/isolator. If chassis-fed, also isolate/remove the chassis battery negative or open the BCC feed to the slide circuit., Grounding best practices: specify cleaning to bright metal, using star/serrated washers on ground lugs, tightening to spec, and protecting with dielectric grease/boot after reassembly., In B4, add explicit guidance: if motor connector access requires trim removal, take controller-input readings first. After Section C access, repeat voltage checks at the motor to localize drops., In D2/D4, advise capturing controller fault codes/LEDs before cycling power or performing resets, as some codes clear on power loss., For in-wall systems, add a comparative current draw check between left/right motors during travel; a side-to-side delta >2‚Äì3 A suggests binding or failing motor/coupler., Refine synchronization guidance: remove the generic 'typically 2‚Äì3 seconds' hold time and say 'hold the switch for the OEM-specified time (commonly 3‚Äì5 seconds)'. Prevents following an incorrect generic value., Add lithium battery/BMS considerations: low-temperature charge/discharge limits or BMS current limiting can mimic low-voltage sag. Ensure SOC adequate and BMS not in protect/low-temp state during diagnostics., Solar isolation note: prefer opening the PV disconnect/breaker or removing PV fuse at the controller. If covering panels, use purpose-made opaque covers, avoid abrasion, and be mindful of heat buildup and wind., Through-frame removal: add instruction to support/locate the cross-shaft to prevent lateral shift when the motor/coupler is removed; mark shaft position and align set screws with shaft flats/dimples. Use jam nuts if provided., Clarify in-wall motor fastener caution: aluminum rail threads are easily stripped‚Äîuse OEM torque (25‚Äì35 in-lb is only an example) and avoid over-torque., Add a note to minimize bench-test duration for loose motors and secure the assembly against torque reaction when applying 12 V directly., Add polarity/connector orientation verification steps: confirm 5-pin keying and motor lead polarity before first jog; if direction is reversed on through-frame, swap the two motor leads with power removed., Electrical verification enhancement: include a dedicated ground-drop measurement at both the controller and motor grounds during movement; target <0.2 V. Document both readings., Post-repair enablement: add a final step to re-enable shore/gen/inverter/solar in a controlled sequence after all tests, verifying no unexpected loads or faults., Sealing detail: after reseal and water test, verify wiper seal orientation and corner moldings are properly seated; document sealant type and lot if required by warranty., Documentation addition: record whether measurements were with or without alternator/chargers enabled, and capture min/max voltage and peak/inrush current for traceability., Maintenance note: include inspection of resettable breakers and main ground lugs in the annual checklist; add inspection of slide topper hardware (if equipped) as it can influence load and skew alignment., Safety clarification: emphasize never forcing in-wall rails manually. If manual movement is required, follow OEM override only; otherwise diagnose and correct the bind first., Troubleshooting addition: include 'thermal trip' as a cause for intermittent/no movement on through-frame motors and controllers; allow cool-down and verify current draw/ventilation.\n‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SOP REGENERATED with Mother/Father corrections applied\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:31:05.051Z"},"sha256":"7f30740d0b196cc1b5f2620ad38f4e9e12c3fd0f0dc7b9aafd8f731565aa91fc"}

Document on the work order.\n- Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) per OSHA 1910.147:\n  - Disable all energy sources: unplug shore power; generator OFF; inverter/charger OFF; disable AGS (Automatic Generator Start); cover solar panels or open/remove solar charge controller fuses/breakers.\n  - Turn the coach battery disconnect to OFF (disconnect). Apply a lockable device to the battery disconnect if equipped; otherwise remove the negative house battery cable.\n  - Apply a lockout hasp to the removed negative cable or terminal and install each person‚Äôs personal lock(s) and tag(s). Insulate and cap the removed negative lead.\n  - Remove the slide circuit fuse(s)/open slide breakers and pocket them or place in a lockable LOTO box. Tag the controller and slide switch ‚ÄúDo Not Operate.‚Äù\n  - Install insulating covers over exposed positive battery terminals; ensure battery compartment ventilation; no smoking/ignition sources near batteries.\n  - Verify 0 VDC at the slide controller/motor feed with a multimeter, then perform a try-out: attempt to operate the slide to confirm zero energy. Note: Some controllers draw nonzero standby current; do not assume zero without measuring.\n  - Group LOTO: Each person applies and removes their own lock. The lead tech verifies all personnel are clear before re-energizing.\n  - Re-energization sequence: Clear area; confirm all tools/cribbing are removed from pinch zones or, if needed for testing, are intentionally placed and personnel are clear. Announce ‚Äúenergizing.‚Äù Reinstall slide fuse/close breaker, remove only the necessary tag(s) for test. After tests, de-energize and restore LOTO as needed for adjustments.\n- Emergency stop: Releasing the slide switch immediately stops motion. Only one operator at the switch. Use ‚Äúclear and call‚Äù before any movement.\n- Fall protection and ladder safety (OSHA Subpart D):\n  - Use Type IAA ladders on level ground at 4:1 angle; keep belt buckle between rails; do not stand on top two steps; secure/foot the ladder; do not carry tools while climbing‚Äîuse a hoist/rope or tool belt. Consider fall protection/extra precautions for prolonged work above 6 ft. Suspend ladder/lift operations in high winds or lightning; manage wet/icy surfaces to prevent slips.\n- Lifting/forklift/rigging (OSHA 1910.178):\n  - Pre-use inspect forklift and slings; ensure WLL tags/date legible. Use taglines to control loads. Establish exclusion zones; never allow personnel under a suspended load; keep forks lowered when personnel are nearby. Use rated slings/straps with edge protection and known WLL. Two-person lifts for subassemblies; clear communications.\n- Pinch/crush:\n  - Heavy moving room and gears. Maintain exclusion zones. Crib or mechanically block the room/assemblies with rated stands/cribbing on solid substrate before anyone enters pinch zones. Never rely solely on hydraulic jacks.\n- Electrical hazards:\n  - 12 VDC can deliver high current; converters energized on shore power. Use insulated tools; remove metal jewelry; eye protection required when working on battery lugs. Keep AC cords/tools on GFCI protection during any water testing. Shield controllers/connectors from direct spray; dry area before rework.\n- Battery/chemical/fire:\n  - Maintain adequate ventilation for battery compartments. Keep baking soda/water available for acid neutralization and spill kit for solvents. No open flames/ignition sources; control overspray. Keep a Class ABC fire extinguisher within reach. Prohibit ignition sources during and shortly after aerosol/solvent application until vapors dissipate; ensure good ventilation.\n- PPE:\n  - Minimum: safety glasses, cut-resistant gloves; nitrile or chemical-resistant gloves when handling solvents/sealants; hearing protection as needed; safety-toe footwear for lifting/forklift work; long pants. Use respiratory protection or enhanced ventilation per SDS when spraying PTFE lubricants or applying sealants in confined spaces. Tie back hair; remove jewelry; avoid loose items near rotating parts.\n- Hazard Communication (OSHA 1910.1200):\n  - Review SDS for all chemicals (cleaners, sealants, lubricants). Label secondary containers. Follow PPE and ventilation per SDS. Dispose of wastes per local hazardous waste rules.\n- Structural stability:\n  - Park on solid, level surface; wheel chocks; deploy stabilizers/jacks per OEM. Level per OEM guidance; use jacks to level coach prior to slide operation.\n\nEMERGENCY_RESPONSE:\n- Immediate actions (stop-work authority for any person on site):\n  - Electric shock: Do not touch victim if still in contact with source. De-energize via LOTO or disconnect source; call 911. Begin CPR/AED if trained once area is safe.\n  - Crush/pinch injury: Hit emergency stop (release switch). Do not reverse motion unless it removes load safely. Call 911 for serious injury. Stabilize load with cribbing before extrication.\n  - Fall: Do not move the person unless in danger. Call 911 if head/neck/back injury suspected.\n  - Chemical exposure: Eyes‚Äîuse eyewash/saline for at least 15 minutes; remove contact lenses. Skin‚Äîremove contaminated clothing; rinse with water. Ingestion‚Äîdo not induce vomiting; call Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) and 911 as needed. Refer to SDS first aid.\n  - Fire: Use Class ABC extinguisher only if small and safe to do so; otherwise evacuate and call 911.

Secure to floor and wall:\n   - Drill pilots as required; confirm path is clear. Start all fasteners by hand. Tighten in OEM-specified sequence and torque for the fastener size/grade and substrate. Record actual torque values applied. Verify plumb with a 4-ft level before final torque. Apply paint witness marks on set screws/couplers and critical fasteners after torque. Photo: Centering measurement and torque wrench in use.\n5. Rollers/pads:\n   - Verify interior rollers/pads condition, location, and height per OEM. Replace worn/damaged rollers; adjust heights to support room bottom straight and level. Perform a paper-pull test along the slide floor edge to verify even roller support; adjust to eliminate localized overloading.\n\nSection C: Slide Room Installation and Attachment\n1. Prepare slide room:\n   - Install gear racks per OEM; verify racks are parallel and equidistant from the reference flange on both sides using a steel ruler. Check room box diagonals again after rack install; confirm squareness.\n2. Insert slide room:\n   - Use forklift with padded forks and edge protection. Maintain exclusion zone; use taglines. Guide into cutout; align racks with drive gears; rest on interior rollers/pads. Push in to mid-travel. Spotters inside/outside. Crib/support room if working near pinch zones.\n3. Attach arms/brackets:\n   - Install connecting hardware finger-tight to allow adjustment. Verify rack-pinion mesh contact along full width with minimal backlash per OEM. Photo: Proper rack-pinion mesh and hardware fitted.\n\nSection D: Electrical Wiring, Controller Mounting, and System Adjustments\n1. Wiring (with power isolated and slide fuse removed/open):\n   - Source protection: Install an in-line fuse/breaker as close to the source as practicable per OEM/code; typically within 7‚Äì12 in of the battery or at a designated distribution point. Do not insert/close the device yet.\n   - Wire sizing: Select conductor gauge per OEM and to achieve a 3‚Äì5% design target voltage drop at peak current using round-trip length (source to controller/motor and back). Acceptance under load: ‚â§5‚Äì10% unless OEM specifies stricter. Document gauge, round-trip run length, and peak current basis.\n   - Routing: Use loom, grommets, drip loops, and abrasion sleeves at penetrations; maintain clearance from moving/hot parts. Secure with UV-rated ties/mounts at appropriate intervals.\n   - Grounding topology: Prefer a dedicated negative return conductor of equal gauge back to the battery/bus unless OEM specifies chassis return. If chassis is used, verify low-resistance bonding per OEM and code. Terminate grounds to clean bright metal; use star washers; apply OEM-approved anti-corrosion compound.\n   - Connections: Crimp with correct dies; heat-shrink. Maintain polarity per OEM diagram.\n   - Controller mounting: Mount controller in a dry, ventilated location with connectors oriented downward where possible and with drip loops to minimize water ingress. Follow OEM clearances and fastener recommendations.\n   - Polarity/functional pre-check: Using a low-current test method or OEM procedure (still de-energized for full power), verify correct polarity/direction at the motor connector prior to powered jogging. Photo: Switch and motor connections, source device location near source, ground prep, controller mounting orientation.\n2. Initial alignment (controlled jog):\n   - Re-energization for test: Clear area; announce. Reinstall slide fuse/close breaker. Remove only the slide switch tag for testing; maintain ‚Äúclear and call.‚Äù Keep shore power OFF initially.\n   - Jog a few inches only. Measure reveals and flushness at defined points (top/middle/bottom at both sides). Adjust vertical/horizontal bolts in small increments to equalize. Check near-full extend and near-full retract. After each adjustment, de-energize per LOTO before entering pinch zones.\n3. End stops/controller settings:\n   - R&P systems without programmable controllers: Adjust only mechanical stop cans/blocks (if equipped) per OEM.\n   - Systems with programmable controllers: Only set end positions if the specific OEM procedure for this mechanism directs it. Never use controller settings to compensate for mechanical misalignment. Set OUT when interior seals fully and face is flush per OEM; set IN when exterior flange compresses outer seal evenly (OEM target compression). Record procedures used. Tighten all adjustment/mounting bolts to final OEM torque and apply paint witness marks. Photo: Even exterior compression and interior flush.\n\nSection E: Final Sealing, Water Testing, and Acceptance\n1. Exterior sealing:\n   - With room fully retracted, mask edges as needed. Apply continuous non-sag bead over top and down both sides of exterior flange-to-wall joints. Tool smooth and continuous. Do not seal the bottom edge; confirm weep/drain paths remain open and clean. Avoid self-leveling products on crowned/sloped edges where runoff could block weeps.\n2. Functional cycling:\n   - Restore power; run 3‚Äì5 full cycles. Observe smooth, even travel without binding or grinding; reveals remain even; no abnormal noises. Verify topper/awning clearance, reinstallation, bracket alignment, and tension per OEM before final tests.\n3. Electrical verification under load:\n   - Using a DMM and clamp meter, measure and record:\n     - Source voltage at battery/bus.\n     - Voltage at controller/motor during peak load on both positive and negative paths to isolate return issues.\n     - Peak and steady-state current.\n   - Acceptance: Voltage at controller/motor under peak load within ‚â§5‚Äì10% drop from source unless OEM stricter.\n4. Water tests (GFCI and shielding):\n   - Ensure any AC tools/cords are on GFCI. Shield electrical connectors and controller from spray. Use a gentle, top-down sweeping spray; keep nozzle ‚â•12‚Äì18 in from surfaces; no pressure washers.\n   - Retracted test: Soak perimeter for 10‚Äì15 min. Inspect interior perimeter with flashlight and dry towel.\n   - Extended test: Extend room fully; soak slide roof perimeter, top and side seams, and topper interfaces for 10‚Äì15 min. Inspect interior and under edges. Dry area before any rework. Reseal and retest if any leak. Photo: Finished exterior with sealant bead; water test in progress.\n5.

Verify exact model, switching pole configuration (hot-only vs hot+neutral), priority, and delay on the nameplate/wiring diagram.\n- System topology: Identify whether the inverter is upstream of the ATS, downstream feeding a subpanel, or separate. This affects isolation and test sequence.\n- Personnel: Qualified RV service technicians or licensed electricians trained in RV electrical systems, LOTO, and safe energized testing. A second person is recommended during live tests.\n- Limits: Preventive maintenance only. Do not open or repair internal contactors/PCB. Replace the ATS if heat damage, cracked insulators, welded/pitted contacts, or coil/control failures are found. Always follow the torque/wiring values printed on the ATS label; if this SOP conflicts with the label, follow the label.\n\nSAFETY_SPECIAL_NOTES:\n- Electrical hazard (120V AC): Shock and arc risk from shore, generator, and potential inverter backfeed. De-energize all sources (unplug shore, disable generator auto-start, turn off inverter pass-through/transfer). Apply LOTO. Verify zero energy using a three-point test with a LoZ method: test known live, test the ATS points, re-test known live. Use CAT III 600V meter/leads with finger guards. One-hand rule; use clip leads when possible.\n- Ghost voltage: High-impedance DMMs can show induced/phantom voltage. Use LoZ function or a burdened tester (e.g., solenoid) to confirm absence of energy.\n- NCVT limitations: NCVT is for preliminary screening only; it does not detect neutral faults or verify de-energization.\n- Arc/thermal hazard: Loose lugs overheat and can cause fire. Inspect for discoloration/odor; verify conductor size and material; torque to the manufacturer spec with a calibrated tool; replace damaged components.\n- Neutral-ground bonding: On shore power, the RV neutral must be isolated from ground. The neutral is bonded only at the service source (shore pedestal) or generator per design. Verify the ATS neutral switching configuration and ensure no N‚ÄìG bond exists in the RV/ATS when on shore.\n- Contact cleaners/solvents: Many are flammable and can attack plastics or wick into coils. Use only non-residue, plastic-safe, nonflammable products sparingly. Ensure complete evaporation per the product SDS and allow adequate ventilation before re-energizing.\n- PPE: Safety glasses, cut-resistant gloves, and rubber insulating gloves Class 00/0 with leather protectors for energized verification. Inspect and air test rubber gloves before use. Hearing protection during generator tests as needed. N95 respirator for dust/rodent cleanup.\n- Mechanical/cut hazard: Sharp edges in compartments. Wear cut-resistant gloves; handle covers carefully.\n- Fall/ergonomics: Chock wheels, level RV, ensure stable footing/lighting; use kneeling pad.\n- Noise/exhaust: Ventilate during generator operation; keep bystanders clear.\n- Fire/foreign object: Clean work area; remove all debris/tools before re-energizing. Do not leave loose items (including desiccant) inside the enclosure or block ventilation.\n\nMATERIALS_LIST:\n- LOTO devices and tags (shore plug lock, generator/inverter lockouts)\n- Wire/cable labels (shore L1/N, GEN L1/N, LOAD L1/N), service label/date tag\n- Cleaning: 99% isopropyl alcohol, lint-free wipes, ESD-safe soft brush, plastic-safe non-residue nonflammable electrical contact cleaner, nonflammable air duster\n- Torque seal (witness mark lacquer)\n- Replacement strain-relief bushings/clamps sized/listed for the cable type; enclosure gasket or butyl if needed\n- UV-rated cable ties and tie mounts\n- Anti-oxidant compound (only if aluminum conductors are confirmed and per manufacturer)\n- Ferrules/pin adapters only if the ATS terminals are listed/rated for them (correct AWG)\n- Listed AL-to-CU transition connectors (e.g., AlumiConn/Polaris) if aluminum conductors are present and ATS lugs are CU-only\n- Desiccant pack (optional; secure in breathable pouch away from conductors; do not obstruct ventilation)\n- Documentation forms: maintenance checklist, test log, photo log\n\nTOOLS_LIST:\n- PPE: safety glasses, cut-resistant gloves, rubber insulating gloves Class 00/0 with leather protectors; N95 respirator (as needed); hearing protection\n- Lighting: flashlight/headlamp; inspection mirror; optional borescope\n- Calibrated torque screwdriver/wrench covering device-specified ranges (confirm on label). Record model/SN and calibration due date on work order; do not use out-of-calibration tools for final torque.\n- Insulated screwdrivers (flat/Phillips), nut drivers as applicable; insulated probe tip covers\n- True-RMS multimeter CAT III 600V with LoZ function or separate LoZ/solenoid tester; leads with alligator clips/finger guards\n- Clamp meter (optional) for load current and to check neutral/EGC current; optional IR thermometer/thermal camera\n- Known resistive load (e.g., space heater or microwave) for under-load testing\n- Smartphone/camera for documentation\n- Small vacuum with ESD-safe brush (optional)\n- Kneeling pad; magnetic parts tray; portable CO monitor (optional)\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_A_TITLE: Pre-Job Setup, Site Safety, and Source Isolation\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_A_STEPS:\n1. Verify work order, VIN, and owner authorization. Identify ATS model, label, and wiring diagram. Sketch a simple one-line diagram of the system showing shore, generator, ATS, inverter (upstream/downstream/subpanel), and main panel.\n   Photo: Exterior showing pedestal and RV shore cord; ATS label/wiring diagram close-up.\n2. Plan LOTO: Identify shore pedestal, generator controls/auto-start, and inverter transfer/pass-through settings. Identify any other sources (solar/inverter-charger) that can backfeed.\n   Photo: Each identified source/control point.\n3. De-energize shore: Open pedestal breaker; unplug 30A shore cord; apply plug lock and ‚ÄúDo Not Energize‚Äù tag.\n4. Disable generator: Set to OFF; disable auto-start; if applicable, remove start fuse or disconnect start battery per OEM; tag ‚ÄúDo Not Start.‚Äù\n   Photo: Generator controls showing OFF/disabled with tag.\n5. Disable inverter transfer/pass-through so it cannot backfeed. For systems with inverter-fed subpanels, turn off inverter output and any backfeed paths. Tag controls if applicable.\n6. Preliminary screen: Use NCVT to check enclosure/cables for unexpected voltage (screening only; not a substitute for metering).\n7. Access ATS compartment with adequate lighting and stable footing.\n   Photo: ATS enclosure as found before opening (labels, routing).\n8. Don PPE: safety glasses, cut-resistant gloves; prepare rubber insulating gloves with leather protectors; inspect and air test rubber gloves.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_TITLE: Safe Access and Zero-Energy Verification\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_B_STEPS:\n1.

Identify terminals: Shore (utility), Generator (GEN), and Load (to panel) L1 (hot) and N (neutral), and ground bar. Confirm with wiring diagram on cover/label. 30A RV systems have one hot leg (L1) and a neutral (no L2). Many Furrion 30A ATS models switch both the hot and the neutral (two-pole); confirm on the nameplate and follow the device‚Äôs specific pole configuration.\n3. Three-point absence-of-voltage test using LoZ:\n   - Verify meter on a known live source (e.g., pedestal receptacle elsewhere or a proving unit).\n   - With LoZ or a burdened tester, measure:\n     ‚Ä¢ Shore L1‚ÄìShore N; Shore L1‚Äìground; Shore N‚Äìground\n     ‚Ä¢ Gen L1‚ÄìGen N; Gen L1‚Äìground; Gen N‚Äìground\n     ‚Ä¢ Load L1‚ÄìLoad N; and optionally Load N‚Äìground\n   - Expected: 0 VAC (may read near 0 with LoZ). If any measurable voltage is present, stop, re-isolate sources, and eliminate backfeed.\n   - Re-verify the meter on the known live source after testing to confirm instrument operation.\n   Use one-hand rule; use insulated gloves and clip leads where possible.\n   Photo: Meter display showing 0 VAC at one representative set with probes visible.\n4. Do not strike or tap components. Instead, lightly support harnesses and check that contactor/relay and PCB mounting screws/standoffs are secure by visual inspection and gentle manual confirmation (de-energized only).\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_TITLE: Detailed Inspection and Cleaning\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_C_STEPS:\n1. Visual‚Äîconductors/insulation: Inspect shore, gen, and load conductors from jacket to lug for discoloration, melted insulation, nicks, exposed strands, improper strip length.\n   Photo: Close-ups of shore, gen, load terminals before any work.\n2. Visual‚Äîterminals/contactor/PCB/enclosure: Look for bluing, oxidation, pitting, soot, insect/rodent debris, moisture staining, bulged components, cracked insulators, melted plastics, or warped cover.\n3. Smell test: Note burnt/acrid odors indicating overheating.\n4. Clean:\n   - Blow off loose debris with short, controlled bursts of nonflammable air at an angle; loosen debris with an ESD brush; vacuum gently. Avoid directing air into coils/relays.\n   - Light grime on insulation: wipe with 99% IPA-dampened lint-free wipe; do not saturate; avoid coils and PCB.\n   - Minor terminal surface oxidation: apply plastic-safe, non-residue, nonflammable contact cleaner sparingly to the metal clamp area only; prevent wicking into coils/PCB; dry completely per SDS before re-energizing.\n   - If contacts appear pitted/welded or housing heat-damaged, plan to replace the ATS (do not open or file contacts).\n   Photo: Interior after cleaning, same framing for comparison.\n5. Strain relief/bend radius: Verify all cable clamps/bushings are secure and listed for the cable type (e.g., SOOW/SJOOW). Ensure ‚â•5√ó cable diameter bend radius; no tension at lugs. Adjust as needed.\n6. Chassis bonding/mounting: Verify ATS enclosure is securely mounted. Check low-resistance continuity between the ATS chassis and RV chassis ground (zero out meter leads; expect very low resistance, typically <0.5 Œ© depending on lead compensation). Inspect/torque equipment grounding conductor terminations per bar spec.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_TITLE: Conductor Verification and Torque (Securement)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_STEPS:\n1. Locate and record lug torque spec and conductor listings from the ATS label/inside cover (e.g., AWG range, Cu-only or Al/Cu, strand class, ferrule/pin acceptance if stated). Use only the printed specs; do not guess.\n2. Conductor material/type:\n   - Verify conductor AWG (30A typically 10 AWG Cu).\n   - Identify copper vs aluminum. If aluminum conductors are present and ATS lugs are CU-only, do not land AL in the ATS. Transition to copper with a listed AL-to-CU connector in an appropriate junction box outside the ATS; apply anti-oxidant to AL per connector manufacturer; then land copper in the ATS.\n   - Fine-strand conductors (Class K/M): Use ferrules or pin adapters only if the ATS terminals are listed/rated for them per the manual/label. If not listed, terminate bare only if the terminal is rated for the strand class; otherwise transition to a compliant copper pigtail using a listed connector outside the ATS.\n3. Torque approach (one conductor at a time):\n   - If there is no evidence of heating/creep and the termination appears sound, first check torque: apply the specified torque with a calibrated tool. If the screw does not move before reaching spec, do not loosen or disturb the conductor.\n   - If the screw turns before reaching spec, or if any damage/discoloration is evident, de-energize (confirm), then loosen, remove, and inspect the stripped end (full strands, correct length, no corrosion). Re-prepare as needed, reinsert fully (insulation just shy of clamp), and torque to spec with a calibrated tool.\n   - Sequence: Shore L1, Shore N; Gen L1, Gen N; Load L1, Load N; then verify/torque ground bar terminations per bar spec.\n   - Maintain perpendicular tool alignment; steady pressure to avoid cam-out.\n   - Apply a small torque-seal witness mark from screw head to lug after final torque.\n   Photo: Close-ups post-torque with visible torque-seal.\n4. Ferrules/pin adapters (only if listed): Trim square; crimp with the correct die using a ratcheting tool; verify pull-out; insert and torque to spec.\n   Photo: Example ferrule before insertion and after torque.\n5. Conductor slack/routing: Ensure a modest service loop (10‚Äì20% slack), dress and tie away from moving parts/cover edges and sharp points. Maintain separation from hot components.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_TITLE: Power Quality, Functional Testing, and Transfer Verification\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_STEPS:\n1. Reinstall cover loosely for live tests: Install at least two opposite screws to reduce exposure while allowing probe access if needed. Keep fingers/tools clear when energized.\n2. Shore pedestal verification before connecting:\n   - Meter TT-30 receptacle: L‚ÄìN 114‚Äì126 VAC; L‚ÄìG 114‚Äì126 VAC; N‚ÄìG ‚âà 0 V; correct polarity. Reject and do not connect to an unsafe pedestal (open neutral, reversed polarity, or out-of-range voltage).\n3. Prepare shore test: Turn RV panel branch breakers OFF to limit inrush. Generator remains disabled. Plug in 30A cord; close pedestal breaker.\n4. Verify shore at load: Prefer measuring at RV panel main lugs. Expect 114‚Äì126 VAC L1‚ÄìN. If measuring at ATS load terminals, use insulated gloves and clip leads where possible. Note ATS indication (LEDs) if present.\n   Photo: Meter reading of shore voltage at panel or ATS load.\n5. Apply a light load (e.g., converter/charger). Observe ATS for a single clean pull-in; no chatter or abnormal hum. If neutral switching is present, confirm no unintended N‚ÄìG bond by clamping the equipment grounding conductor (EGC) under light load; expect near-zero current in EGC in shore mode.\n6. Generator transfer test:\n   - Simulate loss of shore (open pedestal breaker/unplug) or follow label priority if model specifies. Enable/start generator per OEM.\n   - Observe delay per the model label (most Furrion units have fixed generator priority and a fixed ~20‚Äì30 s delay; adjustment is typically not user-accessible‚Äîdo not attempt to alter timing). Time and record.\n   - Verify load voltage from generator 114‚Äì126 VAC; listen for one clean pull-in; no chatter.\n   Photo: Timing record with ATS/generator status.\n7. Re-transfer to shore: Stop generator; reapply shore power. Observe transfer back per label logic (immediate or delayed). Record behavior and time.\n8. Under-load performance and thermal check:\n   - On shore, apply a known resistive load (e.g., heater/microwave) drawing a moderate current.\n   - Measure voltage drop across the ATS under load:\n     ‚Ä¢ Shore hot-in to load hot-out (L path)\n     ‚Ä¢ Shore neutral-in to load neutral-out (N path)\n     Expect very low drop. Investigate if per-path drop exceeds ~100‚Äì150 mV at moderate load, or if total L+N exceeds ~250‚Äì300 mV.\n   - Optional IR scan of the ATS cover/enclosure for hot spots; elevated temperature suggests re-open and re-check terminations.\n9. Final de-energize for closure: Open pedestal breaker and unplug; generator OFF. Verify 0 VAC at ATS load using three-point LoZ method before final closing if you re-open.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_TITLE: Finalization, Reassembly, and Documentation\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_STEPS:\n1. Interior final check: No tools/debris inside; torque-seal marks intact; cable routing clear; strain reliefs secure; desiccant (if used) secured in a breathable pouch away from conductors and not obstructing ventilation.\n2. Close and secure cover fully: Seat evenly; install all screws; snug evenly (do not strip). Wipe exterior.\n3. Restore service: Plug in shore; close pedestal breaker. Turn ON RV main and needed branch breakers sequentially. Return inverter to normal mode; restore generator auto-start if applicable; remove LOTO.\n4. Final checks: Listen for normal operation; verify key loads work; observe briefly for any abnormal sounds/smell.\n   Photo: Final installation view with cover on, cables dressed, and power restored.\n5. Documentation and recordkeeping (attach to work order):\n   - ATS model/part number, serial number, and clear photo of the wiring diagram/label.\n   - System topology sketch; note neutral switching (yes/no) per nameplate.\n   - Measured shore/gen voltages at load, transfer delay times, under-load voltage drops (L and N paths), load current used for tests.\n   - Torque specifications from label and terminal-by-terminal results (at spec/no movement vs re-terminated).\n   - Conductor materials (Cu/Al), strand class, use of ferrules/pin adapters (only if listed), any AL-to-CU transitions and materials used.\n   - Any abnormalities found/corrected; photos before/after cleaning.\n   - Torque tool make/model/SN and calibration due date.\n   - Service/date label applied in compartment.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING_ISSUES:\n- ATS chatters on generator start:\n  Cause: Low generator voltage/frequency during warm-up; insufficient or failed internal delay; loose connections.\n  Action: Verify generator output; record delay (most Furrion delays are fixed/not user-adjustable); re-torque lugs; check under-load voltage drop. If chatter persists with correct voltage/frequency and secure terminations, replace ATS.\n- No transfer to generator:\n  Cause: No generator output at GEN input; failed coil/control; internal fault.\n  Action: Verify GEN input voltage at ATS during run; check internal fuses only if the manual indicates user-serviceable fusing; control circuits are typically not field-repairable‚Äîreplace ATS if faulty.\n- Shore available but no load output:\n  Cause: Burned shore contacts or loose shore lug; welded/stuck contact.\n  Action: De-energize; inspect for heat damage; verify torque; if contactor damaged/welded/open, replace ATS.\n- Burning smell/discoloration:\n  Cause: High-resistance termination or damaged contactor.\n  Action: De-energize immediately; replace damaged wire/ATS; verify correct conductor gauge/type; re-terminate and torque to spec; confirm under-load voltage drop after repair.\n- Backfeed detected between sources or unexpected voltage:\n  Cause: Miswiring (neutrals tied incorrectly; jumper on hots); inverter backfeed; neutral not switched where required.\n  Action: Compare to label diagram; correct terminations; ensure neutral isolation per design; confirm inverter topology and fully disable transfer; re-test with LoZ three-point method.\n- Audible hum under load:\n  Cause: Normal magnetization vs excessive due to low voltage or internal fault.\n  Action: Verify 114‚Äì126 VAC at load; check under-load voltage drop; if hum is loud or heat observed, replace ATS.\n- Neutral-ground bond issue (GFCI/RCD trips, EGC current under shore load):\n  Cause: Improper N‚ÄìG bond inside RV/ATS or inverter configuration.\n  Action: Inspect for neutral tied to ground bar; confirm ATS neutral switching design; correct wiring; ensure bond only at the appropriate source (shore service equipment or generator per design).\n\nMAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE:\n- Inspect, clean, and torque-check annually (12 months).\n- Extra inspections after water intrusion, rodent activity, extended high-load usage (>80% rated for >1 hour), rough-road travel/vibration, pedestal faults, or any heat/burning evidence.\n- Post-service follow-up: After any re-termination or component replacement, recommend a field check under typical load after 30‚Äì60 minutes (thermal scan and voltage-drop measurement) and re-check torque after 1 month of operation.\n\nREFERENCED_DOCUMENTS:\n- Furrion 30A ATS Installation/Owner‚Äôs Manual (model-specific wiring/torque, pole configuration, priority/delay)\n- NEC (NFPA 70) Article 551 Recreational Vehicles and RV Parks\n- NFPA 1192 Standard on Recreational Vehicles\n- UL 1008 Transfer Switch Equipment (or applicable listing/recognition for the ATS model)\n- RVIA/RVDA AC system service best practices\n- Product SDS for cleaners/solvents used\n\nDEFINITIONS_TERMS:\n- ATS: Automatic Transfer Switch that switches the load between shore and generator with a defined priority/delay.\n- Shore Power: External 120V AC utility power from a pedestal (TT-30 for typical RV 30A).\n- Generator (GEN): Onboard AC source driven by an engine.\n- Load: RV AC distribution panel fed by the ATS.\n- LOTO: Lockout/Tagout to ensure equipment remains de-energized during service.\n- Torque Seal: Witness paint applied to fasteners after torquing.\n- Pass-Through (Inverter): Inverter function routing shore/gen AC through to loads when available.\n- Ferrule/Pin Adapter: Crimped sleeve/solid pin used to improve termination of fine-strand wire‚Äîuse only if the terminal is listed/rated for it.\n- LoZ Measurement: Low-impedance voltage measurement that suppresses ghost voltage for reliable absence-of-voltage verification.\n- AL-to-CU Transition Connector: Listed device for splicing aluminum to copper conductors.\n\nCRITICAL:\n- Always defer to the specific torque, wiring, priority, pole configuration (hot-only vs hot+neutral), and timing information printed on the ATS label/manual.\n- Do not open, file, or ‚Äúclean‚Äù internal contactor contacts; replace the ATS if internal contact damage/overheating is suspected.\n- Verify conductor material compatibility: do not land aluminum on CU-only lugs; use listed AL-to-CU transitions outside the ATS.\n- Use ferrules/pin adapters only if expressly allowed by the ATS terminal listing/instructions.\n- Verify neutral-ground isolation in shore mode and correct bonding in generator mode per design.\n- Use a three-point LoZ absence-of-voltage test; do not rely on NCVT alone.\n- Never perform energized internal adjustments. Live measurements must be performed with appropriate PPE, insulated tools, and preferably with a second person present. Record torque tool calibration details in the work order.\n\n---\n\n**üìä ARBITRATION NOTES:**\n‚Ä¢ Terminology: \"30A RV systems are single-pole (L1 and N; no L2)\" is misleading. While there is only one hot leg, many Furrion 30A ATS models switch both the hot and the neutral (two-pole). This must be clarified and verified on the nameplate/wiring diagram.\n‚Ä¢ Ferrules: SOP allows ferrules on fine-strand conductors without stating that the terminal must be listed/rated for ferrules. Using ferrules on terminals not rated for them can violate listing and lead to loose connections.\n‚Ä¢ Aluminum conductors: SOP does not instruct to verify that ATS lugs are CU-only or AL/CU. Many RV ATS lugs are CU-only; landing aluminum directly would be noncompliant. Guidance for AL-to-CU transitions is missing.\n‚Ä¢ Zero-energy verification: Using a fixed threshold (0‚Äì1 VAC expected, >3 VAC stop) can be unreliable due to capacitive/ghost voltages on DMMs. SOP does not require a low-impedance (LoZ) measurement or the three-point meter test (known-live before and after) to verify instrument operation.\n‚Ä¢ Mechanical check: \"Gently tap contactor housing\" is a nonstandard practice and could damage components. Better methods exist to detect looseness.\n‚Ä¢ Contact cleaner use: No explicit caution that many cleaners are flammable, can wick into plastics/coils, and must be plastic-safe; drying time before re-energizing is not emphasized.\n‚Ä¢ Neutral-ground bonding: SOP does not explicitly require verification that neutral is isolated from ground in the RV when on shore power and bonded only at the generator (or per inverter design). This is critical to avoid parallel neutral/ground paths.\n‚Ä¢ Rubber insulating gloves: SOP lists Class 00/0 gloves but omits leather protectors and glove inspection/air test before use.\n‚Ä¢ Torque tools: No requirement to verify torque tool calibration status/date and record it.\n‚Ä¢ Grounding/mounting: SOP does not explicitly instruct checking ATS chassis bonding, mounting integrity, or continuity of the equipment grounding conductors.\n‚Ä¢ Thermal/voltage drop assessment: Surface IR of the closed cover can miss internal hot spots; SOP lacks guidance to measure under-load voltage drop across the ATS/terminations to identify high-resistance connections.\n‚Ä¢ Inverter backfeed: SOP mentions disabling inverter pass-through but does not distinguish systems where the inverter feeds a subpanel or where the ATS is upstream/downstream of the inverter. This can affect isolation and testing sequence.\n‚Ä¢ Transfer delay adjustability: Troubleshooting mentions adjusting delay \"if model allows\" without warning that many Furrion delays are fixed and not user-adjustable.\n‚Ä¢ Desiccant use: SOP includes desiccant packs but does not caution against blocking ventilation or leaving loose items inside the enclosure.\n‚Ä¢ Shore pedestal verification: No step to verify pedestal wiring/voltage before plugging in (reversed polarity, open neutral, high/low voltage).\n‚Ä¢ NCVT reliance: NCVT is used as a preliminary check without noting its limitations (cannot detect neutral faults/ghosts); this could provide false confidence if used alone.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ Revise terminal description to: \"30A RV systems have one hot leg (L1) and a neutral (no L2). Many Furrion ATS models switch both hot and neutral‚Äîconfirm on the unit label and wiring diagram, and follow the device's specific pole configuration.\"\n‚Ä¢ Add a three-point test for absence of voltage: verify meter on a known live source, test the ATS points, then re-verify on the known live source. Use a LoZ meter/function or apply a burden (e.g., solenoid tester/resistive load) to eliminate ghost voltage.\n‚Ä¢ State: \"Use ferrules only if the terminal is listed/rated for ferrules per the ATS manual/label. Otherwise, terminate bare per manufacturer instructions.\"\n‚Ä¢ State: \"Verify lug material rating (CU-only vs AL/CU). If conductors are aluminum and lugs are CU-only, transition to copper using a listed AL-to-CU connector (e.g., AlumiConn/Polaris) outside the ATS, apply anti-oxidant to AL per manufacturer, and land copper in the ATS.\"\n‚Ä¢ Replace the tapping step with: \"Inspect contactor/relay mounting and fasteners for security; gently shake wiring (de-energized) to confirm no movement; do not strike components.\"\n‚Ä¢ Add cleaner cautions: use only non-residue, plastic-safe, nonflammable contact cleaner; apply sparingly to exposed clamp surfaces only; prevent wicking into coils/PCB; allow full evaporation before energizing.\n‚Ä¢ Explicitly verify neutral-ground relationship: On shore power, confirm no neutral-to-ground bond within the RV/ATS (visual check: neutral isolated from chassis/ground bar; functional check: no neutral current on EGC with clamp meter under light load if practical). On generator, confirm bonding per generator design and ATS neutral switching configuration.\n‚Ä¢ PPE detail: Require rubber insulating gloves Class 00/0 with leather protectors; perform glove air test/inspection before use; use insulated probe tip covers and clip leads when possible.\n‚Ä¢ Torque tools: Record tool model/SN and calibration due date on the work order; do not use out-of-calibration tools for final torque.\n‚Ä¢ Torque approach: Check torque first. If at/near spec and no discoloration/creep is evident, do not loosen. If below spec or damage is evident, de-terminate, inspect, and re-terminate to spec.\n‚Ä¢ Add grounding checks: Verify low-resistance continuity between ATS chassis and vehicle chassis ground; inspect/torque equipment grounding conductor terminations per bar spec.\n‚Ä¢ Under-load performance check: With a known resistive load, measure voltage drop across the ATS (shore hot-in to load hot-out, and neutral-in to neutral-out). Expect very low drop; investigate if per-path drop exceeds ~100‚Äì150 mV at moderate load or if total exceeds ~250‚Äì300 mV.\n‚Ä¢ Clarify inverter architectures: Identify whether the inverter feeds a subpanel or is upstream/downstream of the ATS. Ensure the isolation/functional tests reflect the actual topology to avoid backfeed.\n‚Ä¢ Add note: \"Most Furrion 30A ATS units have fixed generator priority and a fixed ~20‚Äì30 s delay; adjustment is typically not user-accessible. Follow the label/manual.\"\n‚Ä¢ Desiccant: If used, secure in a breathable pouch away from conductors; do not obstruct ventilation; replace when saturated.\n‚Ä¢ Shore pedestal test: Before connecting, meter the TT-30 receptacle for 114‚Äì126 VAC L‚ÄìN, near 0 V N‚ÄìG, and correct polarity; reject unsafe pedestals.\n‚Ä¢ Add meter safety: Use CAT III 600V or better leads with finger guards; keep one hand behind back when probing energized parts; use clip leads where possible.\n‚Ä¢ Recordkeeping: Capture ATS model/part number, serial number, and a photo of the wiring diagram/label; log measured voltages, transfer times, torque values per terminal, and tool calibration details.\n‚Ä¢ Cable/strain relief: Verify strain reliefs are listed for the cable type used (e.g., SOOW/SJOOW); ensure bend radii and no jacket stripping beyond clamp area.\n‚Ä¢ Post-repair follow-up: After any re-termination or component replacement, recommend a thermal scan and voltage-drop check under typical load after 30‚Äì60 minutes of operation.\n‚Ä¢ Pedestal/gen re-energization: Note that some contact cleaners/IPA are flammable; ensure full evaporation before live testing; wait time per product SDS.\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ [object Object]\n‚Ä¢ ‚è±Ô∏è Rate-limited processing applied\n‚Ä¢ üîÑ Interactive query approach used for large content\n\n**Consensus Level:** 90%","timestamp":"2025-09-01T00:56:42.928Z"},"sha256":"2de228aecd6501639ea01cae8d6ce86c8da36a6f425ee8fd75cd1160488cc6fb"}

Verify cabinet opening and squareness: Measure width/height/depth and note squareness. Confirm fit per the new unit‚Äôs template/specs.\n   Photo: Tape showing each dimension.\n2. Document clearances: Measure bottom-of-microwave to cooktop, side clearances to cabinetry/walls, and overhead cabinet depth. Compare to OEM-required minimums; document results. If noncompliant‚Äîstop and escalate.\n3. Identify and document rear wall/backer structure:\n   - Use stud/backer finder and borescope through small, controlled pilot points (within template-safe zones) to locate OEM backers, wood studs, or aluminum frame members intended for OTR support.\n   - Note wall composition (panel thickness, foam insulation, voids). Photograph findings.\n   - Prohibit use of toggle bolts in RV exterior walls or thin unknown panels; rear plate must engage OEM-specified backers/studs or approved reinforcement.\n4. Locate hidden services: Inspect visually and with borescope for wiring, gas lines, plumbing, or ducting behind the mounting area. Set drill-stop collars to limit depth. If any risk is identified‚Äîadjust hole locations within template allowances or escalate.\n5. Seal exploratory holes: Patch and seal any unused borescope/pilot holes to maintain the RV air/vapor barrier and prevent odor/moisture ingress (e.g., appropriate sealant/plug; use UL 181 foil tape over vapor barriers if applicable).\n6. Mark wall centerline: Mark a vertical plumb centerline on the rear wall.\n7. Position rear wall template: Align template centerline to wall mark and bottom edge per instructions; tape securely.\n8. Locate studs/backers and mark holes: Choose hole locations that engage OEM backers/studs for lag/wood screws per template. Where no backer is present, do not select hollow-wall toggle locations without OEM-approved reinforcement.\n9. Position top cabinet template: Tape the top template under the upper cabinet; mark top bolt holes and cord hole if not present. Confirm that for recirculating setups, the upper front discharge grille will not be obstructed by cabinet valances/trim or doors; adjust or escalate if airflow would be blocked.\n   Photo: Templates taped with all hole locations marked and backer locations highlighted.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_TITLE: Drilling, Cord Protection, and Rear Plate Installation\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_D_STEPS:\n1. Hot-work precautions: Clear combustibles; place ABC extinguisher within reach; fit drill-stop collars to limit penetration; assign a brief fire watch after drilling/cutting; capture debris with protection/HEPA vacuum.\n2. Prepare cord hole (if needed): Drill a 1.5\" cord hole through cabinet floor per template, using a drill-stop and backing block to protect insulation/voids. Deburr edges; install plastic/nylon grommet/bushing. Install a cabinet-mounted cord clamp/strain relief that will secure the microwave cord after routing.\n3. Drill fastener holes:\n   - Size pilots per OEM fastener diameter and backer material. If OEM does not specify: for wood backers use a pilot about 70‚Äì85% of the screw‚Äôs minor (root) diameter; for 1/4\" lag screws pilot ‚âà3/16\" in wood; for aluminum/steel use OEM self-drilling fasteners or proper tap drill per fastener spec. Avoid oversizing; maintain template accuracy.\n   - Rear plate: Drill pilots only at stud/backer locations; size other holes strictly per OEM hardware. Use depth stops to avoid penetrating exterior skin/insulation.\n   - Top cabinet: Drill holes for top bolts per template (often 3/8\"); use backing to prevent tear-out.\n4. Rear plate installation (OEM hardware only):\n   - Verify surface flatness: Dry-fit and confirm the plate sits flat against the mounting surface. If backsplash thickness or wall unevenness prevents full contact, use OEM-approved spacers/shims behind the plate (not between microwave and plate) to maintain full tab engagement and level.\n   - Position plate; start fasteners into backers/studs first. Snug lag/wood screws using a low clutch to avoid overdriving/crushing laminates.\n   - If OEM permits and backers are absent: install approved reinforcement (e.g., continuous steel/aluminum backing plate spanning to structural members) or through-bolting to accessible structure using large fender washers/plates; exterior penetrations are out of scope‚Äîescalate for OEM plan if required.\n   - Level the plate; then fully tighten per OEM torque guidance. If no torque given, tighten snug and secure without crushing wood or deforming sheet metal; record method, locations, and torque if applicable.\n   Photo: Plate installed, level centered, with fastener/backer locations indicated.\n5. Prohibited anchors:\n   - Do not use toggle bolts or hollow-wall anchors in exterior RV walls or thin unknown panels.\n   - Do not drill through exterior skin/roof within this SOP.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_TITLE: New Microwave Preparation (Do Not Open Outer Case)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_E_STEPS:\n1.

For typical RV recirculation, rotate the blower per OEM instructions accessible via the top/front grille area. Do not open the unit‚Äôs outer case. Install or stage the charcoal filter as required (recirculation).\n4. Route power cord and secure: Feed cord through the grommeted cabinet hole; ensure no pinch points and leave a small service loop. Ensure the service loop cannot contact hot cooktop lamps, sharp edges, or the vent fan inlet. Secure the cord with the cabinet cord clamp/strain relief to prevent creep/abrasion and to keep excess length away from heat/moving parts.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_TITLE: Lifting, Hooking, and Securing the New Microwave\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_F_STEPS:\n1. Two-person lift and hook: With one tech on each side, lift the unit, tilt forward, engage the rear case flange slots onto the wall plate tabs, and seat fully.\n   Photo: Back of unit correctly hooked to plate tabs.\n2. Secure top cabinet bolts:\n   - Insert top bolts with washers through cabinet holes into the threaded inserts on the microwave. Hand-start to avoid cross-threading, then tighten evenly.\n   - Torque: Use manufacturer‚Äôs specified torque if provided. If not specified, tighten to snug and secure without crushing wood or deforming sheet metal. As an advisory reference only, many OTRs accept roughly 30‚Äì35 in-lb; do not exceed 40 in-lb. Use lock washers or medium-strength threadlocker only if allowed by OEM. Record torque/method applied.\n   - Use fender/large washers or reinforcement plates on the cabinet top if cabinet material is thin (<1/2\") or compromised. Escalate if cabinet integrity is questionable.\n3. Cord and grille: Verify the cord is not pinched; secure within the cabinet clamp and away from heat/moving parts. Install the upper grille if removed.\n4. Alignment and stability: Confirm front face is parallel to adjacent cabinetry and unit is flush. Perform a controlled push/pull check by hand from the lower front edge; the unit should not shift on the bracket. Recheck top-bolt torque.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_TITLE: Ventilation System Setup and Checks\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_G_STEPS:\n1. Knockouts/blank-offs: Select and remove only the OEM internal knockouts/blank-offs that correspond to the chosen vent path (recirculating or ducted). Seal unused paths per OEM.\n2.

Recirculation discharge clearance: Confirm that the upper front discharge grille is unobstructed by cabinet valances/trim/doors. Adjust trim or escalate if airflow is restricted.\n5. Ducted systems (if applicable within scope):\n   - Verify duct type and routing are OEM-approved (smooth metal preferred; avoid flex where prohibited). Confirm damper orientation and free movement.\n   - Seal all accessible duct joints with UL 181 foil tape (no cloth/duct tape). Avoid screws intruding into airflow where OEM disallows.\n   - Verify and maintain exterior hood; weather-seal perimeter with approved RV exterior sealant if rework is needed. Creation of new penetrations is out of scope‚Äîescalate.\n   Photo: Damper shown open with tool/finger indicating movement path; photo of sealed joints (if applicable).\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_TITLE: Electrical, Functional, and Performance Testing (No Empty Runs)\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_H_STEPS:\n1. Restore power: Remove locks/tags in sequence. Plug the cord into the cabinet outlet. Restore power sources (shore/inverter/generator) and turn the breaker ON. If using a generator for testing, run outdoors only, exhaust directed away from openings, and confirm CO detectors operate via test button.\n2. Outlet voltage (idle) and polarity recheck: Measure at the receptacle with the microwave idle. Expected 114‚Äì126 VAC; confirm correct polarity/ground if not already documented. Record values.\n3. Reinstall turntable components before any operation: Install the roller ring and glass tray. Never operate the microwave empty.\n4. No-load controls (without RF load): Open/close door; verify interior light on door open. Test cooktop lights and vent fan speeds. Listen for abnormal noises.\n5. Turntable and interlock check with water load: Place 1 cup (250 mL) of water in the center. Run a 10‚Äì15 second cycle to verify smooth, quiet rotation. Start another short cycle and gently open the door; all operation must stop immediately. If not‚Äîde-energize and escalate.\n6. Heating performance test:\n   - Water: 250 mL at 68‚Äì72¬∞F (20‚Äì22¬∞C). Record start temperature and altitude if known.\n   - Run 2:00 at full power. Record end temperature and delta T. Pass criteria guidance: For a typical 1000‚Äì1100 W OTR at sea level, water temperature should approach near-simmer to near-boiling in ~2‚Äì3 minutes (often 60‚Äì90¬∞C rise, 108‚Äì162¬∞F). At higher altitudes, boiling point drops; adjust expectations accordingly. If results are low, check line voltage under load, altitude, and load placement before escalating.\n   Photo: Thermometer before and after, cup centered.\n7. Vent airflow check:\n   - Recirculating: Tissue should show firm intake at bottom grille and consistent discharge at the top front grille (unobstructed).\n   - Ducted: Tissue deflects outward at exterior hood; damper fully lifts. Optional: record anemometer reading.\n   Photo: Tissue deflection at intake and at exterior hood (if ducted).\n8. Load voltage/current (optional but recommended):\n   - During water heating, monitor voltage; should stay ‚â•108 VAC.\n   - Measure current using a plug-in line splitter or an inline power meter; do not clamp around an intact 3-conductor cord. Compare to nameplate (typ. 9‚Äì14 A). Record values.\n9. Monitor for issues: Slight ‚Äúnew appliance‚Äù odor during initial cycles can be normal. Strong or persistent burning/insulation smells, visible arcing (especially near waveguide cover), grinding, scraping, or rattles are abnormal‚Äîstop, de-energize, and follow Troubleshooting.\n\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_I_TITLE: Finalization, Documentation, and Handover\nPROCEDURE_SECTION_I_STEPS:\n1.
