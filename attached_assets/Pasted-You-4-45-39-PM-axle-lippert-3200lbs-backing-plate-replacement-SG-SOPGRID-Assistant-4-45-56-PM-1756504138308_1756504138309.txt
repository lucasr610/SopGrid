Replacing a backing plate on a Lippert 3200lbs axle requires careful attention to detail and adherence to safety procedures. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Safety First:**

* **Chock the wheels:** Securely chock the wheels on the opposite side of the axle you're working on to prevent any rolling.

* **Jack and support:** Safely jack up the trailer and support it with sturdy jack stands placed on the frame, never solely rely on the jack. Ensure the trailer is stable before proceeding.

* **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Wear appropriate safety glasses, gloves, and hearing protection.

**Tools and Materials:**

* **New backing plate:** Ensure you have the correct replacement backing plate for your specific Lippert 3200lbs axle. Lippert offers different configurations, so verifying the part number is critical.

* **Jack stands:** Rated for the weight of your trailer.

* **Lug wrench:** To remove the wheel and hub.

* **Socket set and wrenches:** Various sizes will be needed depending on the specific hardware on your axle.

* **Hammer:** May be needed for persuasion.

* **Torque wrench:** Essential for properly tightening the lug nuts and other fasteners. Refer to your trailer's owner's manual for specific torque specifications.

* **Brake cleaner:** To clean the hub and braking components.

* **Anti-seize lubricant:** For application to the studs and mating surfaces to prevent future corrosion and seizing.

* **Replacement hardware (if necessary):** Inspect the existing hardware for wear and tear; have replacements on hand if needed.

**Procedure:**

1. **Remove the wheel and tire:** Use the lug wrench to remove the lug nuts and then the wheel and tire assembly.

2. **Remove the hub/drum:** Depending on the brake type (electric or hydraulic), you may need to disconnect the brake wiring or hydraulic line. Then, carefully remove the hub/drum assembly. If it's stuck, a few taps with a hammer on the drum face (avoiding the studs) might help break it free.

3. **Inspect the brakes:** Since you have the drum off, it's an excellent opportunity to inspect the brake shoes and other components for wear and tear. Replace if necessary.

4. **Remove the old backing plate:** The backing plate is usually held in place by several bolts. Locate and remove these bolts. You may encounter some resistance due to rust or corrosion. Penetrating oil can be helpful in these situations.

5. **Install the new backing plate:** Position the new backing plate, ensuring it aligns correctly with the axle flange. Install the new bolts or reuse the old ones if they are in good condition. Apply anti-seize lubricant to the bolts.

6. **Reassemble the brakes (if applicable):** Carefully reassemble the brake components onto the new backing plate. Ensure everything is seated correctly and securely.

7. **Reinstall the hub/drum:** Carefully slide the hub/drum assembly back onto the spindle, ensuring proper alignment. Reconnect the brake wiring or hydraulic line if applicable.

8. **Reinstall the wheel and tire:** Place the wheel back onto the studs and hand-tighten the lug nuts.

9. **Lower the trailer:** Once the wheel is on, carefully lower the trailer and remove the jack stands.

10. **Torque the lug nuts:** Using a torque wrench, tighten the lug nuts to the manufacturer's specified torque.

11. **Test the brakes:** After completing the replacement, thoroughly test the brakes to ensure they are functioning correctly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Consult your trailer's owner's manual:** Always refer to your specific trailer's owner's manual for detailed instructions and torque specifications.

* **If you're uncomfortable with any part of this process, consult a qualified RV technician.** Brake systems are critical for safety, and improper installation can have serious consequences.

* **Consider replacing both backing plates at the same time,** especially if one has failed. This will help ensure even braking performance and reduce the likelihood of future issues.

This detailed guide provides a general overview. The specific steps may vary slightly depending on the exact configuration of your Lippert 3200lbs axle and brake system. Always prioritize safety and consult your owner's manual or a qualified RV technician if you have any doubts.
